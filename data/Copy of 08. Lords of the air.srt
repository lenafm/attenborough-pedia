1
00:01:19,727 --> 00:01:23,356
White storks. If you wanted to pick one bird

2
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:26,400
as a representative
of all the birds in the world,

3
00:01:26,447 --> 00:01:29,200
you could do worse
than pick the white stork.

4
00:01:29,327 --> 00:01:32,637
It's a marvellous flyer, an intrepid traveller.

5
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:38,366
This pair will have come from Africa
to nest in this small town in Bavaria.

6
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:42,520
They have
complicated courtship and greeting rituals

7
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:45,076
and they're devoted parents.

8
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:50,161
Just as they could stand for all the birds
in the world, so this, a stork's feather,

9
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:55,725
could be seen as a key to everything
that is most crucial about a bird.

10
00:01:55,887 --> 00:01:59,277
The feather is a marvellous aerofoil.

11
00:01:59,247 --> 00:02:04,002
Man has yet to invent anything as strong,
weight for weight.

12
00:02:04,527 --> 00:02:10,238
It's also an extremely efficient insulator,
and that too is important to the bird.

13
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:13,279
And it's a very complicated structure.

14
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:16,922
This feather has several hundred
separate filaments

15
00:02:17,247 --> 00:02:20,398
on either side of the central quill.

16
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:24,035
They are held together
to form one continuous surface

17
00:02:24,087 --> 00:02:27,841
by several hundred thousand
microscopic hooks.

18
00:02:28,927 --> 00:02:34,638
The feather is the individual creation
of the birds.

19
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,917
No other kind of animal possesses it.

20
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:41,957
And the oldest known feather in the world
was discovered as a fossil

21
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:46,006
in the rocks only a few miles from here
in Bavaria.

22
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,042
It's two and three-quarter inches long,

23
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:52,045
preserved in miraculous detail,

24
00:02:52,527 --> 00:02:57,203
and to all intents and purposes
it looks identical with a stork feather.

25
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:24,156
That feather had been found by men quarrying
limestone near the little town of Solenhofen.

26
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:28,917
The stone had been laid down
about 150 million years ago

27
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:31,318
at the bottom of a shallow lagoon,

28
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:36,845
and its fine, even texture
made it ideal for use in lithographic printing.

29
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:41,683
That texture also makes it
a superb preserver of fossils.

30
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:46,244
The feather tantalised the world of science.

31
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:48,675
What sort of creature could it have come from?

32
00:03:49,087 --> 00:03:53,444
Well, immediately, there was a huge search
mounted in these quarries.

33
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:57,241
Even now, it's almost impossible
to resist the temptation

34
00:03:57,247 --> 00:04:01,240
of pulling down almost every boulder you see

35
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:06,197
and then opening it like a book
to look at each unopened page

36
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:11,600
to see whether maybe...
it contains yet another fossil.

37
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:18,957
And after nearly a year, in 1861,
in this very quarry,

38
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,478
they found what they'd been looking for.

39
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:27,606
A skeleton a foot or so long
surrounded by feathers.

40
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,845
They called it archaeopteryx, "ancient bird".

41
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:35,602
Its skull was missing, but then
another complete skeleton was found.

42
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:39,357
The creature had limbs of equal length,

43
00:04:39,407 --> 00:04:43,958
so if it weren't for the feathers,
it might have been taken for a four-legged runner

44
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:46,118
like a lizard.

45
00:04:46,047 --> 00:04:50,677
Its head was reptilian,
with tiny teeth along its bony jaws.

46
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:56,356
The front limbs had three toes apiece,

47
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:59,320
each toe ending with a claw.

48
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:06,161
The tail was supported by a bony rod,
an extension of the backbone

49
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:08,318
running down the middle.

50
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:12,923
But all around, there are the miraculously
detailed impressions of feathers.

51
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:18,719
In some places, it's possible
to see the filaments on either side of a quill.

52
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:24,603
So those front limbs with claws
are not the legs of a lizard,

53
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:26,922
but the wings of a bird.

54
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:33,525
So perfect are these fossils that we can make
a pretty confident reconstruction.

55
00:05:33,847 --> 00:05:38,443
But could this,
the earliest of birds, flap its wings?

56
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:41,598
Its breastbone has no keel on it
to carry large muscles,

57
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:45,243
so its wing-beats at best
could only have been feeble.

58
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:48,803
It probably depended for the most part
on gliding.

59
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:55,797
The long toes on its feet had a good grasp
both forwards and backwards,

60
00:05:55,807 --> 00:05:59,482
so it would have had no difficulty
in perching on branches.

61
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:05,484
And those claws on its wing doubtless
helped it to steady itself as it clambered around.

62
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:11,565
In all the world today, there is only one
living creature with claws on its wings.

63
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:13,638
And this is it.

64
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:21,355
This is the hoatzin.
Not an adult bird, but a chick.

65
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:25,003
It only possesses claws on its wings
for a week or so.

66
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:30,440
While it does, it gives a vivid hint
of how the first birds may have moved about

67
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:32,762
in their trees.

68
00:06:46,647 --> 00:06:50,003
Maybe the ancestors of archaeopteryx
took to the trees

69
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:54,605
because hungry reptiles roamed below
looking for a meal.

70
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:57,958
The young hoatzin
faces just such dangers today,

71
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:03,405
for its home in the swamps of Venezuela
is haunted by crocodiles and cayman.

72
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:09,118
And reptiles very like them prowled
swamps and forests 150 million years ago.

73
00:07:18,727 --> 00:07:22,003
Although the adult hoatzins
don't have claws on their wings,

74
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:25,363
they still have a very reptilian look to them,

75
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:29,197
with their glittering eyes
surrounded with scaly skin

76
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:30,998
and an odd, bristly crest.

77
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:35,160
Nor do they seem to have mastered flight.

78
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:39,644
They can only cover short distances
before they need a rest.

79
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:44,765
In the branches, they use their wings
to help them keep their balance.

80
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:49,320
But they are true birds
and much better adapted for flying

81
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:51,716
than archaeopteryx ever was.

82
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:54,917
Flyers must reduce their weight to a minimum,

83
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:57,845
and all birds today, including the hoatzin,

84
00:07:57,967 --> 00:08:02,165
have lost the bony tail of the reptile
and have instead a lightweight tail

85
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:04,282
constructed entirely of feathers.

86
00:08:04,847 --> 00:08:07,645
Weight has been reduced at the front end too.

87
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:12,322
Bony jaws and teeth are particularly heavy,
and no modern bird has them.

88
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:15,366
Instead, they have beaks of keratin,

89
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:19,565
the same horny substance
as that from which feathers are made.

90
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:26,440
Keratin is not only light and strong,
but it can easily be moulded into different shapes

91
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:31,635
and turned into the particular tool
a bird needs to gather its food.

92
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:36,444
The hoatzin has an unusual diet.

93
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:41,520
It uses its beak to pluck leaves,
which it then regurgitates for its chick.

94
00:08:57,367 --> 00:09:01,838
Often the beak is elongated
and used as a pair of forceps.

95
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:07,884
The white stork has a medium-sized model
for picking up frogs and little fish.

96
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:14,800
Another stork, the shoebill, has a heavy-duty
version for dragging lungfish from mud,

97
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:18,960
and the crane a short pair
with which to pick up seeds and insects.

98
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:23,557
The butchers among birds
have turned their beaks into hooks

99
00:09:23,927 --> 00:09:27,283
with which to tear flesh: vultures.

100
00:09:32,527 --> 00:09:35,599
The monkey-eating eagle from the Philippines.

101
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:47,166
Others, like the scarlet ibis,
have long probes

102
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:50,483
that can pick out small invertebrates
from their burrows.

103
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:59,646
The beak of a spoonbill
is not in fact a spoon but a sieve,

104
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:02,916
with which its owner collects
small creatures from the water.

105
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:11,959
The flamingo's bill is a filter pump.

106
00:10:11,847 --> 00:10:17,160
The tongue works like a piston, drawing water in
and squirting it out several times a minute.

107
00:10:17,607 --> 00:10:21,236
Coarse hairs on the side of the bill
prevent mud getting in,

108
00:10:21,447 --> 00:10:24,996
and hairs inside
trap microscopic plants and animals.

109
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:29,919
Pelicans.

110
00:10:33,927 --> 00:10:36,395
Some dive on shoals of fish.

111
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:42,723
Others use their baggy bills as nets,
and go fishing in teams.

112
00:10:56,967 --> 00:10:59,197
Another fisherman.

113
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,797
Little fish, it seems,
are eager to swim into the shade.

114
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:06,485
The black heron provides it with its wings

115
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:10,196
and then stabs with precision
at any fish attracted to it.

116
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:15,685
The beak is not only a feeding tool.

117
00:11:15,687 --> 00:11:20,886
It's also essential for keeping in trim
those most valuable of a bird's possessions,

118
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:22,639
its feathers.

119
00:11:22,887 --> 00:11:26,323
They need a lot of maintenance
to be kept in good condition,

120
00:11:26,247 --> 00:11:29,762
and the beak, even the biggest,
is used with great delicacy

121
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:31,918
to preen the feathers one by one,

122
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:37,718
repairing breaks in their veins
by zipping up the hooks on the filaments.

123
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:58,717
Storks, like most birds,
have a preen gland on their rump.

124
00:11:58,887 --> 00:12:03,802
They collect oil from it with their beaks
and use it to waterproof feathers.

125
00:12:08,487 --> 00:12:11,604
Waterproofing is particularly important
for waterbirds,

126
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:16,875
and water only flows off a duck's back
because its feathers are well oiled.

127
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:32,647
But being waterproof does cause problems.

128
00:12:32,487 --> 00:12:37,117
Below water, unwetted feathers hold air
trapped between them like a silver sheath,

129
00:12:37,287 --> 00:12:42,680
and that's very buoyant, so ducks and ducklings
have to paddle hard with their legs

130
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:46,403
to prevent themselves
from bobbing back to the surface.

131
00:13:07,527 --> 00:13:10,599
The business of getting the beak
down into the mud

132
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:14,926
is made easier by having legs
far back on the body, near the tail.

133
00:13:15,207 --> 00:13:17,801
All the same, it's hard work.

134
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:55,839
As well as oiling their feathers,
many birds, like the peacock,

135
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:57,918
ruffle them in dust.

136
00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:01,879
The skin beneath the feathers
makes an attractive home

137
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:04,477
for parasites like fleas and lice,

138
00:14:04,647 --> 00:14:06,922
and dust bathing helps get rid of them.

139
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:12,205
Another way is to enlist the help
of other insects: ants.

140
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:15,797
Many ants, when irritated, squirt acid,

141
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:19,159
and that will shift most insect parasites.

142
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:23,920
Jays and crows
are particularly addicted to this habit.

143
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:42,916
By spreading its wings, the bird makes it easier
for angry ants to swarm over its skin

144
00:14:43,527 --> 00:14:45,279
between the feathers.

145
00:14:45,447 --> 00:14:50,805
Often, the bird seems to enjoy the process
so much that it goes into a kind of ecstasy.

146
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:15,800
So birds go to a lot of trouble
to keep their feathers in good condition.

147
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:20,285
In truth, their lives depend on them,
not only for support in the air.

148
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,205
Birds are warm-blooded.

149
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:26,958
They have to be to produce the energy
they need for their active lives.

150
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:29,846
So insulation for their bodies is essential,

151
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:33,318
and nothing does it better
than a coat of feathers.

152
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:39,317
Only a bird wrapped in a coat
of fine feathers

153
00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:43,485
can live in the coldest place on earth:
the Antarctic ice cap in winter.

154
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:57,321
Some species of penguin survive temperatures
of 40 degrees below freezing.

155
00:15:57,447 --> 00:15:59,278
And for weeks on end.

156
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:15,081
The feathers of both adult and chick
are specially adapted to provide warmth.

157
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,402
They're very fine and grow in a thick mat.

158
00:16:17,607 --> 00:16:23,443
But the feathers of most birds
have to serve another purpose: flight.

159
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:29,521
If beauty comes from perfection,
if grace is a measure of skill,

160
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:33,885
then a bird in the air
must be among the loveliest sights in nature.

161
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:18,040
Terns are among the most graceful of flyers,

162
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:21,716
responding to every tiny variation
in the wind currents

163
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:26,125
with subtle adjustments
to the contours of the tail and wings.

164
00:17:52,647 --> 00:17:56,196
The tropic bird,
by using updraughts and working hard,

165
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:59,602
can hang in the air to display to its mate.

166
00:18:13,287 --> 00:18:18,407
Ocean-going birds like the frigate
sail on long, thin wings,

167
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:21,525
the best shape for efficient gliding.

168
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:30,404
One of the most skilled gliders of all,
the albatross,

169
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:35,277
which beats up and down the ocean
supported by the lightest of breezes

170
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:38,518
with only the gentlest of flaps of its wings.

171
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:55,837
But long wings for gliding flight
don't make for easy landings.

172
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:14,526
Having missed its touchdown, the booby
has to labour to regain speed and avoid a stall.

173
00:19:28,647 --> 00:19:33,675
The frigate bird has similar problems
but solves them successfully.

174
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:45,035
The booby has another try.

175
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,922
There are helpful winds to be exploited
over land as well as sea,

176
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,646
and above wild, mountainous country
like the Grand Canyon

177
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:08,838
where the sun heats the rock,

178
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:12,966
there are hot thermal currents
that sweep up the cliff faces.

179
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:19,197
So vultures can sail and soar with an economy
that rivals that of the albatross.

180
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:33,838
Such birds as these, sliding effortlessly
through the air, can reach great speeds.

181
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:37,596
But the airspeed record is held
by a much smaller flyer.

182
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:40,402
The swift.

183
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,476
Here, it is in slow motion.

184
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:48,561
One species is said to reach speeds
in level flight of 170km an hour.

185
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:54,037
The swift is the most aerial of birds,
hardly alighting except to nest,

186
00:20:54,527 --> 00:20:56,677
mating and even sleeping on the wing,

187
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:02,204
and every day flying up to 1,000km
to gather insects from the air.

188
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:04,837
Other birds also feed on the wing,

189
00:21:05,087 --> 00:21:09,956
and just as ground feeders
have beaks modified for their diets,

190
00:21:09,887 --> 00:21:15,564
so many of these flying hunters
have beaks suited to their own techniques.

191
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:21,679
And what's more, ones that require
great acrobatic skill to manage properly.

192
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:25,122
The skimmer has the oddest of beaks.

193
00:21:25,247 --> 00:21:29,206
It's the only bird with the lower mandible
longer than the upper.

194
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,875
To use it requires perfect flight control.

195
00:21:40,127 --> 00:21:45,884
When the lower mandible strikes an object
like a fish, the beak automatically snaps shut.

196
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:51,199
Some say there's more to it than that.

197
00:21:52,607 --> 00:21:57,886
The furrow cut in the surface of the water
sparkles and attracts surface-feeding fish.

198
00:21:58,367 --> 00:22:04,124
Having made one run, the skimmer often turns
and flies back along the same course,

199
00:22:04,127 --> 00:22:07,722
perhaps to collect anything
that has taken the lure.

200
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:38,679
In the Andes live other birds
with superb aerial control

201
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:42,443
and extraordinary beaks to manipulate.

202
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:47,476
The detura plant is rich in nectar,
and hummingbirds are nectar addicts.

203
00:22:48,287 --> 00:22:53,884
But those with normal-sized bills
can't reach the supply at the top of the blossoms,

204
00:22:54,047 --> 00:22:57,084
even when they cling to the flowers
with their feet.

205
00:23:02,687 --> 00:23:06,521
The sapphirewing has a somewhat longer bill.

206
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:14,840
But even this can't reach
into the depths of the flowers.

207
00:23:19,487 --> 00:23:22,001
What is needed is this.

208
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:25,518
The outsize beak
of the sword-billed hummingbird,

209
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:28,159
that is longer than its entire body.

210
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:34,603
The bird's flying control has to be total
to manoeuvre this huge instrument, and it is.

211
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:37,236
Slow motion shows how expert it is

212
00:23:37,247 --> 00:23:40,683
in keeping its bill still
in relation to the blossom,

213
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:44,079
even while its body moves in all directions.

214
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:57,162
Slowed down still further,
you can see how the wings move

215
00:23:57,407 --> 00:23:59,762
to enable the bird to hang in the air.

216
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:02,321
The bird tips its body vertically

217
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:06,077
so that air currents from the wings
are driven downwards.

218
00:24:06,047 --> 00:24:09,437
Each wing is so jointed,
it beats in a figure of eight

219
00:24:09,887 --> 00:24:13,641
and produces lift on both the forward
and the backward beat.

220
00:24:13,727 --> 00:24:16,764
Their arms are short and close to the body,

221
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:19,965
so these birds actually fly with their hands.

222
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:40,961
So, with the help of their feathers,
birds have mastered all the manoeuvres in the air.

223
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:45,164
The stork's wings carry it
for thousands of miles

224
00:24:45,407 --> 00:24:48,956
up from Africa to Northern Europe
each spring to nest.

225
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:53,238
Often on exactly the same site
it's used many times before.

226
00:25:06,527 --> 00:25:11,681
The male usually arrives first
and immediately proclaims ownership of the site.

227
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:22,003
The nest must be refurbished.

228
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:27,885
No matter how big it is already, the bird
seems to think it'll be improved with more sticks

229
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:29,879
and a fresh lining.

230
00:25:30,047 --> 00:25:31,446
(CLATTERING)

231
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:35,036
This display not only serves
as a notice of possession.

232
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:37,966
but as an invitation to a mate.

233
00:25:43,487 --> 00:25:47,799
Once the pair have come together,
the ritual is carried out again and again,

234
00:25:47,807 --> 00:25:50,196
strengthening the bond between them.

235
00:25:50,207 --> 00:25:54,359
The sound of the bill clatter
is an integral part of the display.

236
00:25:57,407 --> 00:26:01,161
The nightingale also needs a mate
and a nesting site,

237
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:04,364
but its feathers are drab, its habits retiring,

238
00:26:04,527 --> 00:26:08,440
and it claims them not with a dance
and a clatter but with a song.

239
00:26:08,847 --> 00:26:12,123
A song that penetrates the thickets
in which it lives.

240
00:26:12,207 --> 00:26:13,799
(CHIRPING)

241
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:42,120
Song, like bright feathers,
conveys a third message:

242
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:43,926
identity.

243
00:26:44,847 --> 00:26:46,724
(LIVELY CHIRPING)

244
00:26:47,727 --> 00:26:50,958
This is a relative of the nightingale,
the blackcap.

245
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:55,126
He makes his species clear
with that patch of black on his head.

246
00:26:55,407 --> 00:27:00,197
He also produces a quite different
and very characteristic song.

247
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:13,002
The grasshopper warbler
relies almost entirely on song.

248
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:16,079
That's a rival singing and he must answer.

249
00:27:17,487 --> 00:27:19,318
(LOW-PITCHED WHIRRING)

250
00:27:28,527 --> 00:27:30,245
(SIMILAR SOUND IN DISTANCE)

251
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:55,441
This looks like another grasshopper warbler,

252
00:27:55,407 --> 00:28:01,198
and most birdwatchers, and most birds,
couldn't be quite sure it isn't until it sings.

253
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:03,524
(HIGH-PITCHED CHIRPING)

254
00:28:05,007 --> 00:28:07,475
It's a willow warbler.

255
00:28:07,407 --> 00:28:11,195
So, with song and dance,
identities are established,

256
00:28:11,727 --> 00:28:14,685
territories claimed and the pair bond made.

257
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:24,406
All is now set
for the business of reproduction.

258
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:52,400
Feathers are particularly suited for display.

259
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:56,725
They're light, they can be easily erected
into great fans and crests,

260
00:28:56,847 --> 00:28:59,520
and some birds like the cory bustard

261
00:28:59,727 --> 00:29:03,959
have exploited that potential
to an extraordinary degree.

262
00:29:04,047 --> 00:29:06,959
When male meets male on the African plains,

263
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:10,638
they argue over territory with feathers.

264
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:28,803
The female great bustard
is neatly camouflaged and unobtrusive.

265
00:29:28,527 --> 00:29:32,805
But her mate inflates himself
in the most spectacular fashion.

266
00:29:36,687 --> 00:29:38,882
But one family has excelled all others

267
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:43,558
in the shape, the colour, the sheer beauty
of their display feathers.

268
00:29:43,887 --> 00:29:46,845
They live in New Guinea. The birds of paradise.

269
00:30:27,087 --> 00:30:31,205
This superb bird
has an iridescent shield on its chest,

270
00:30:31,407 --> 00:30:36,242
and on the nape of its neck
a roll of feathers it can open into an umbrella.

271
00:30:37,647 --> 00:30:40,445
The six-wired birds,
and there are several kinds,

272
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:45,683
carry half a dozen naked quills on their heads,
each ending in a small black pennant.

273
00:30:46,287 --> 00:30:50,166
The males display on the ground,
clearing special dancing floors

274
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:54,200
which they tend every day,
keeping them meticulously clean and tidy.

275
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:05,565
The female
has none of the splendour of the male.

276
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:09,516
His life during the breeding season
is devoted to dancing.

277
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:13,366
The females tour the courts
and mate with one of these dandies.

278
00:31:13,647 --> 00:31:19,517
She rears the young by herself
while he continues to strut on his court.

279
00:31:19,887 --> 00:31:23,562
The magnificent bird
sprouts two curling quills from its tail

280
00:31:23,727 --> 00:31:27,083
and has three capes on his shoulders
of different colours.

281
00:31:27,567 --> 00:31:31,606
He too displays on the ground
and strips leaves from saplings

282
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:33,557
so he can dance in a pool of light.

283
00:31:36,207 --> 00:31:39,597
Other birds of paradise
display up in the branches.

284
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:44,245
The males don't acquire these plumes
until they're several years old.

285
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:47,325
They moult them
at the end of the breeding season.

286
00:31:47,247 --> 00:31:51,240
So for much of the time,
they look like their drab females.

287
00:31:51,567 --> 00:31:57,119
When they're dressed for the dance,
they spend a lot of time grooming themselves,

288
00:31:57,327 --> 00:32:03,084
lavishing as much care on their display feathers
as they do on those utilitarian ones

289
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,726
on which they depend for flight.

290
00:32:18,447 --> 00:32:22,235
The females visit the display trees
to select their partners.

291
00:32:22,287 --> 00:32:25,324
But the males display
whether they're there or not.

292
00:32:53,487 --> 00:32:57,878
Each species, this is the lesser bird,
has its own particular dance,

293
00:32:58,287 --> 00:33:03,042
its own characteristic way
of showing off its finery to the best advantage.

294
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:17,998
The Emperor of Germany's bird begins
with a fluffing up of the plumes beneath his wings,

295
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:21,755
but has developed
a surprising climax to his performance.

296
00:33:40,047 --> 00:33:44,802
Count Raggi's bird throws his plumes
over his back in a fountain of red.

297
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:53,802
But to me, the most remarkable
and thrilling display of all

298
00:33:53,967 --> 00:33:56,276
is that of the bluebird.

299
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:15,877
And as he quivers and trembles,

300
00:34:16,047 --> 00:34:22,202
he sings as extraordinary and un-birdlike
a song as comes from the throat of any bird.

301
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:24,519
(PULSING CALL)

302
00:34:59,007 --> 00:35:04,764
And these are some of the largest feathers
in the world, and among the most spectacular.

303
00:35:05,247 --> 00:35:06,646
The peacock's feathers.

304
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,678
They're still something of a mystery.

305
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:14,443
Darwin confessed he was baffled
by the sheer perfection of such feathers as these.

306
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:20,638
Were they really developed just to enable
the peacock to compete in splendour?

307
00:35:20,607 --> 00:35:23,167
Or to impress the peahen?

308
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:28,925
There are many who think we have
some way to go before we know the full answer.

309
00:35:44,607 --> 00:35:49,476
And this is one characteristic of the reptiles
that birds never abandoned.

310
00:35:49,887 --> 00:35:52,321
Laying eggs in nests.

311
00:35:52,287 --> 00:35:57,520
Every other vertebrate group has some species
that retain the eggs in the body

312
00:35:57,567 --> 00:35:59,239
and give birth to live young.

313
00:35:59,487 --> 00:36:02,001
Some fish do it,
some amphibians, some reptiles,

314
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:03,925
and, of course, all mammals.

315
00:36:03,807 --> 00:36:06,605
But there's not a single bird that does it.

316
00:36:06,687 --> 00:36:09,042
The reason is pretty obvious.

317
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,127
It would be a handicap for a bird

318
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:17,121
to fly around with the weight of this in its body,
let alone a whole clutch,

319
00:36:17,247 --> 00:36:20,683
for as long as it takes for it to hatch.

320
00:36:21,087 --> 00:36:26,115
Much better to lay it in a nest
as soon as it forms.

321
00:36:26,847 --> 00:36:30,123
But that, of course,
makes the eggs very vulnerable.

322
00:36:30,207 --> 00:36:34,758
And birds go to a lot of trouble
to protect their eggs and nests.

323
00:36:40,287 --> 00:36:44,678
The peahen makes a nest
in a secluded place in the undergrowth

324
00:36:44,607 --> 00:36:50,239
and forgoes the attention-catching feathers
of her mate to be well camouflaged.

325
00:36:54,207 --> 00:36:57,677
Several waterbirds,
including the giant coot in Chile,

326
00:36:57,567 --> 00:37:03,676
lay their eggs on floating islands of vegetation,
beyond the reach of most robbers.

327
00:37:19,647 --> 00:37:23,083
Other birds,
these are oropendulas from South America,

328
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:28,525
achieve inaccessibility by weaving
bottle-shaped nests on branches.

329
00:37:31,647 --> 00:37:35,560
On the pampas of South America,
the oven bird builds a nest of mud.

330
00:37:36,447 --> 00:37:38,563
It's shaped like a local oven,

331
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:43,487
and when it's finished, it will have
a tiny entrance hole to foil most intruders.

332
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:54,679
Long-tailed tits weave a domed nest
of cobwebs and moss,

333
00:37:54,687 --> 00:37:59,681
fill the inside
with carefully collected downy feathers,

334
00:37:59,967 --> 00:38:02,322
and camouflage the outside with lichen.

335
00:38:03,327 --> 00:38:05,966
The sparrow is one of the untidiest of builders.

336
00:38:05,727 --> 00:38:11,165
It will make use of any sticks,
including those used by others for their nests.

337
00:38:25,407 --> 00:38:28,922
In Iceland,
there are great colonies of Arctic terns.

338
00:38:29,247 --> 00:38:32,762
Shores where they nest
provide little building material

339
00:38:33,087 --> 00:38:34,884
and no cover whatsoever.

340
00:38:35,007 --> 00:38:40,445
So they largely dispense with nests
and deflect intruders by diving at them.

341
00:38:44,127 --> 00:38:48,643
The safety of their eggs
depends largely on their camouflaged shells.

342
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:53,000
Inside, the developing chicks,
like their parents, have warm blood,

343
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,556
and if they get chilled, they die.

344
00:38:57,087 --> 00:39:02,207
The eider duck, which also breeds in Iceland,
develops special downy feathers on its breast

345
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:07,236
and with them
builds one of the warmest of all nests.

346
00:39:11,007 --> 00:39:17,480
Man himself has yet to devise anything
more luxuriously warming than eider-down.

347
00:39:18,687 --> 00:39:22,043
The colour of birds' eggs varies.
So does their size.

348
00:39:22,047 --> 00:39:26,882
This is the smallest of all,
laid by a hummingbird and no bigger than a pea,

349
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:28,758
and this is the biggest.

350
00:39:32,127 --> 00:39:35,597
It's probably the largest egg
that it's possible to have.

351
00:39:35,487 --> 00:39:41,676
Because the shell has to be pretty thick
to hold two gallons of liquid.

352
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:44,560
If it were any bigger,
it might have to be so thick

353
00:39:45,087 --> 00:39:49,239
the young chick inside
would be unable to hammer its way out.

354
00:39:49,407 --> 00:39:53,923
This egg was found here
in these thorn forests of southern Madagascar,

355
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:59,723
and it was laid by a giant, flightless bird,
one of the biggest to have existed,

356
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:03,562
rather like the ostrich, standing ten feet tall.

357
00:40:05,247 --> 00:40:08,557
It was called the elephant bird, or aepyornis,

358
00:40:09,087 --> 00:40:13,046
and it seems that it was alive
up to about 200 or 300 years ago.

359
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:15,885
But now, alas, it's certainly extinct.

360
00:40:18,687 --> 00:40:23,317
Parent birds have to labour hard,
keeping their eggs warm in cold climates,

361
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:28,038
and in warm ones,
protecting them from the sun.

362
00:40:28,287 --> 00:40:33,645
When the eggs hatch, they must collect food
to supply their perpetually hungry young.

363
00:40:38,367 --> 00:40:41,359
Soon, these young storks will fly.

364
00:40:41,247 --> 00:40:43,681
But where exactly will they go?

365
00:40:44,127 --> 00:40:48,837
To find out, stork chicks all over Europe
have been ringed.

366
00:41:12,447 --> 00:41:16,440
The rings are light and of aluminium
and carry an address,

367
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:21,921
so that anyone finding the bird
will know where it was hatched and reared.

368
00:41:25,887 --> 00:41:28,082
The young storks flap their wings,

369
00:41:28,287 --> 00:41:31,802
exercising the muscles
that will have to sustain them in the air,

370
00:41:32,127 --> 00:41:36,439
while their parents continue
to collect daily supplies of frogs and fish.

371
00:41:44,607 --> 00:41:47,121
And then, after about 60 days,

372
00:41:47,487 --> 00:41:50,285
both young and parents depart.

373
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:56,840
The chicks miraculously have most of the skills
of flying the first time they launch.

374
00:42:08,127 --> 00:42:13,076
Some surprising results have come
from ringing storks in this German town.

375
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:16,444
Many of the birds make their way to Africa,

376
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,327
going east around the Mediterranean
via Istanbul.

377
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:22,603
But the town lies on a fork
in the migration route,

378
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:26,397
and others go west
across the Straits of Gibraltar.

379
00:42:26,367 --> 00:42:30,440
And as they head south,
they become more and more concentrated.

380
00:42:30,687 --> 00:42:35,602
These immense journeys
make great demands on a bird's strength.

381
00:42:35,967 --> 00:42:41,917
Many rely on the upward thermal currents
produced when the sun heats the land.

382
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:46,642
If you can get high,
you can glide effortlessly for great distances.

383
00:42:47,007 --> 00:42:49,885
Thermals don't occur over the sea,

384
00:42:49,887 --> 00:42:52,924
so the migrants
gain as much height as they can

385
00:42:53,247 --> 00:42:56,284
before embarking on a crossing
of the Mediterranean.

386
00:42:56,607 --> 00:43:01,965
Near both Gibraltar and Istanbul,
they soar round and round in the upcurrents,

387
00:43:01,887 --> 00:43:03,764
climbing higher and higher.

388
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:07,277
Those that arrive at the coast in the evening
roost,

389
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:11,037
for after the sun has gone down,
there are no more thermals.

390
00:43:11,007 --> 00:43:13,316
It's better to wait until morning.

391
00:43:29,727 --> 00:43:33,003
So the Straits of Gibraltar
each spring and autumn

392
00:43:33,087 --> 00:43:38,081
are visited by thousands of bird travellers
on their way to or from Africa.

393
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:42,599
The nearby mountains and the rock itself,
warming in the Mediterranean sun,

394
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:46,362
produce particularly strong upcurrents of air,

395
00:43:46,527 --> 00:43:50,884
and Africa lies only a few kilometres away
across the strait.

396
00:43:52,287 --> 00:43:55,802
A kestrel, taking a rest on its long journey.

397
00:43:58,527 --> 00:44:03,647
Honey buzzards from much of Europe
congregate here and share the thermals.

398
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:24,116
These great invasions of tourists
infuriate the local residents.

399
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:28,759
Sometimes, on dull days,
the short-toed eagles can't get the lift they need

400
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:32,442
for launching off to Africa
and fly around Gibraltar harbour.

401
00:44:32,607 --> 00:44:36,600
The local gulls don't care for such intrusion
and mob them.

402
00:44:36,927 --> 00:44:41,443
Sometimes they drive them down
into the water.

403
00:44:41,727 --> 00:44:45,163
Just another hazard
in the risky business of migration.

404
00:44:53,247 --> 00:44:57,763
A black kite on its way back to Africa
after breeding in Europe.

405
00:44:58,047 --> 00:45:01,642
September in Gibraltar
is a marvellous place for the birdwatcher

406
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:05,958
as travellers congregate at this international
crossroads of migration routes.

407
00:45:06,207 --> 00:45:09,916
One of the best places to watch
is from the top of the rock.

408
00:45:13,527 --> 00:45:17,759
It's coming to the end of the day
and it's been a good one for the migrants.

409
00:45:18,327 --> 00:45:23,003
Parties of big birds, 30, 40, 50-strong,
have been passing the rock

410
00:45:23,127 --> 00:45:26,961
and gathering to get one last lift
from a thermal in Europe

411
00:45:26,967 --> 00:45:33,202
so they can gain altitude and
glide across the straits to Africa, 12 miles away.

412
00:45:33,207 --> 00:45:35,767
But how did they find their way here?

413
00:45:36,087 --> 00:45:39,602
Some undoubtedly
used geographical landmarks.

414
00:45:39,927 --> 00:45:42,236
They come along the coast.

415
00:45:42,327 --> 00:45:45,239
Others follow prominent river valleys.

416
00:45:45,207 --> 00:45:47,402
But that can't be all there is to it,

417
00:45:47,607 --> 00:45:52,362
because young birds that have never
made the journey can do so by themselves.

418
00:45:52,407 --> 00:45:57,276
So they must have some kind of inherited map
in their minds.

419
00:45:58,647 --> 00:46:01,764
Other birds manage
to use the sun in some way

420
00:46:02,007 --> 00:46:07,639
because they can cross large expanses
of sea and even featureless land.

421
00:46:07,767 --> 00:46:11,123
But the sun has one drawback
as a navigational aid.

422
00:46:11,127 --> 00:46:14,517
It moves,
so if you want to find your way by it,

423
00:46:14,487 --> 00:46:16,443
you have to know what the time is.

424
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:21,199
So those birds, presumably,
must also have a clock in their minds.

425
00:46:21,207 --> 00:46:25,758
But in the evening, of course,
the sun goes down, it gets dark,

426
00:46:26,007 --> 00:46:29,966
and you may no longer
be able to see geographical landmarks.

427
00:46:30,327 --> 00:46:31,965
What happens then?

428
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:38,638
The answer can be found here
in the air traffic control tower at the rock.

429
00:46:38,487 --> 00:46:43,003
Gibraltar is of great strategic importance
in the defence of Western Europe

430
00:46:43,287 --> 00:46:48,122
and close watch is kept by radar
of all aircraft movements around it.

431
00:46:48,087 --> 00:46:53,002
But radar can show up flocks of birds
just as it can show up aircraft.

432
00:46:53,367 --> 00:46:58,487
And in the autumn and spring, the information
that can come from these screens

433
00:46:58,647 --> 00:47:02,799
about what goes on in the skies at night
is spectacular indeed.

434
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:10,320
A few hours of an autumn night
can be condensed into a few seconds.

435
00:47:10,647 --> 00:47:14,037
The numbers of birds
crossing the straits into Africa

436
00:47:14,487 --> 00:47:18,605
can be estimated from the mass
of black dots moving south-west.

437
00:47:18,807 --> 00:47:24,325
On this night, up to 200,000 birds at one time
are represented on the screen.

438
00:47:24,567 --> 00:47:30,403
It's estimated that 5,000 million
cross the Mediterranean each autumn.

439
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:36,076
How do they find their way?

440
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:39,798
Well, some birds seem to fly by the stars.

441
00:47:39,927 --> 00:47:45,160
If you release them in a planetarium
where artificial stars have been twisted around,

442
00:47:45,207 --> 00:47:47,516
they fly by way of those.

443
00:47:47,607 --> 00:47:51,919
Others are sensitive to electromagnetic waves.

444
00:47:51,927 --> 00:47:57,638
It appears that a bird not only has to have
a map of the land and a star chart and a clock,

445
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,727
but also a compass in its mind.

446
00:48:00,567 --> 00:48:06,483
But the fact remains, there's still a great deal
we don't know about bird navigation.

447
00:48:07,767 --> 00:48:11,362
Gibraltar is only a halfway stage
for most migrants.

448
00:48:11,607 --> 00:48:15,395
Arctic terns hatched in Iceland in July

449
00:48:15,447 --> 00:48:17,199
are here in September,

450
00:48:17,367 --> 00:48:22,236
but they still have 10,000km to go
before they reach their destination.

451
00:48:23,607 --> 00:48:25,757
Shearwaters move in a different direction,

452
00:48:26,007 --> 00:48:29,886
migrating east and west between
the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.

453
00:48:29,847 --> 00:48:31,519
They're great travellers.

454
00:48:31,767 --> 00:48:36,477
One returned to its nest in Wales,
crossing the Atlantic in 12 days.

455
00:48:40,407 --> 00:48:44,446
This Arctic tern has now reached
the southern tip of South America.

456
00:48:44,247 --> 00:48:47,956
Having left the Arctic at the end of summer,
when the sun never set,

457
00:48:48,087 --> 00:48:53,684
it's flying to the Antarctic summer,
so it sees more daylight than any other creature.

458
00:48:58,167 --> 00:49:01,443
The African plains are the target for the storks.

459
00:49:01,527 --> 00:49:04,758
By the end of September,
they're feeding among game

460
00:49:04,887 --> 00:49:09,165
just as they did among dairy cows
a few weeks earlier.

461
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:13,480
So flight, the birds' supreme achievement,

462
00:49:13,527 --> 00:49:16,519
has carried them
not only to all parts of the world,

463
00:49:16,407 --> 00:49:19,638
but has made them
into the greatest of all animal travellers.

464
00:49:20,247 --> 00:49:24,559
And yet, most surprisingly,
some species have abandoned it.

465
00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:27,764
The ostrich's ancestors could certainly fly.

466
00:49:27,927 --> 00:49:30,566
Its body still retains adaptations for flight.

467
00:49:30,807 --> 00:49:33,526
A beak instead of heavy teeth and jaws,

468
00:49:33,687 --> 00:49:38,124
and feathers on its wings
that sprout in patterns needed for flight.

469
00:49:38,007 --> 00:49:41,079
But now they're used only for display.

470
00:49:53,847 --> 00:49:57,920
Since the feathers need no longer
support the bird in the air,

471
00:49:58,167 --> 00:50:00,681
the hooks on the filaments have disappeared

472
00:50:01,047 --> 00:50:03,481
and the feathers have a soft fluffiness

473
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:08,885
that is found to be alluring by other creatures
as well as female ostriches.

474
00:50:44,247 --> 00:50:48,081
But why should the ancestral ostrich
have given up flight?

475
00:50:48,567 --> 00:50:51,843
Well, flying is a very demanding business.

476
00:50:51,927 --> 00:50:55,476
If there are no ferocious predators
to drive birds into the air,

477
00:50:55,767 --> 00:50:58,600
it's much easier to remain on the ground.

478
00:50:58,647 --> 00:51:03,926
That often happens today on islands,
and it happened once to the ostriches.

479
00:51:11,607 --> 00:51:16,761
Ostriches belong
to one of the most ancient of the bird families.

480
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:21,360
When they first appeared,
about 50 million years ago,

481
00:51:21,687 --> 00:51:26,442
the dinosaurs and other giant reptiles
had only recently vanished,

482
00:51:26,487 --> 00:51:30,196
and the position of ruler of the world
was vacant.

483
00:51:30,327 --> 00:51:34,798
It seems that birds like that made a bid for it.

484
00:51:35,127 --> 00:51:38,085
There was one great flightless bird
in North America

485
00:51:38,007 --> 00:51:40,237
that had a huge, murderous bill,

486
00:51:40,407 --> 00:51:44,002
that looked as though
it could kill any animal around.

487
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:51,803
And even looking at the ostriches, it's not hard
to imagine how dangerous they might be

488
00:51:51,927 --> 00:51:56,205
if they suddenly acquired a taste for red meat.

489
00:51:56,247 --> 00:52:02,197
They could certainly outrun me, and one kick
could knock me over and rip me open.

490
00:52:02,487 --> 00:52:06,241
But that bid for supremacy by the birds failed.

491
00:52:06,327 --> 00:52:09,922
There was another, unobtrusive, creature
around at the time

492
00:52:10,167 --> 00:52:12,522
that also had warm blood.

493
00:52:12,567 --> 00:52:15,957
But it was descended
from a different group of reptiles,

494
00:52:16,407 --> 00:52:20,525
and it insulated its body
not with feathers but with fur.

495
00:52:21,207 --> 00:52:25,598
That was the creature
whose descendants were to inherit the earth.

496
00:52:25,527 --> 00:52:28,280
That was the first mammal.
