1
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,795
Birds are the most accomplished aeronauts
the world has ever seen.

2
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,154
They fly high and low.
At great speed and very slowly.

3
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,671
And always with
extraordinary precision and control

4
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,758
But birds are not the only creatures in the air.

5
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,717
There are also small furry mammals,
bats, like these in Texas.

6
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,229
They are so competent in the air

7
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,116
that they have just made a journey from Mexico,
a thousand miles away,

8
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,357
simply in order to rear their young in this cave,

9
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,870
which is particularly suitable for them
as a nursery.

10
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,232
Just now they are flying out
to catch their evening meal of insects.

11
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,876
But they had better be careful,
because in the skies above them

12
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,390
there lurks a creature that can outfly them.

13
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,830
It is, of course, a bird. A red-tailed hawk.

14
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,953
Bats with their fluttering zig-zag flight
are not easy targets,

15
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,676
and a hawk needs all its aerobatics skills
and powers of concentration

16
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,953
if it is to snatch one
out of the confusing multitude.

17
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,638
That is one bat
that will not return to the roost tonight.

18
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,871
The red-tail lives beside the cave
and is well practised in bat-catching.

19
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,710
This prairie falcon, on the other hand,
is a visitor, but it's learning fast.

20
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,230
Unlike the hawk, it chooses to eat
its meals on the wing.

21
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,519
Bats are latecomers to the skies.

22
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,235
They've only been flying
for a mere 60 million years.

23
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,356
The air was first colonised
200 million years earlier still by the insects,

24
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,439
but now they can't escape the birds either.

25
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,560
Some insects, of course, have powerful weapons
with which to defend themselves.

26
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,355
But a bee-eater certainly knows
how to deal with a bee.

27
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,916
A rub against the perch
usually discharges the sting.

28
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:44,433
And if that doesn't, then a sharp nip
will squirt the venom harmlessly into the air.

29
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,220
Dragonflies first flew around 350 million years ago

30
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,390
and insects had the skies to themselves
for 150 million years thereafter.

31
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,752
And then a different kind of animal
joined them in the air.

32
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:29,998
As the dinosaurs dominated the land,
so the pterosaurs now ruled the skies.

33
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:41,194
Pterosaurs had wings of skin, stretched between
one enormously elongated finger and their flanks.

34
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,996
They flew over the sea as well as the land.

35
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,392
It seems likely that some roosted on cliffs

36
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,718
and launched themselves into the air
as gannets do today.

37
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,432
They probably snatched fish
from the surface of the sea,

38
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,313
and some certainly fell into it.

39
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,832
Their bodies were buried by mud;
the mud turned to limestone

40
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,195
and eventually became exposed in
great quarries like this one in Southern Germany.

41
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,635
Today, separating the layers of sediment

42
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,674
is just like searching through
the pages of a visitor's book

43
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,714
that hasn't been opened
for 150 million years.

44
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,036
0f course, nearly all
of the pages are absolutely blank.

45
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,312
Visitors, after all, were very few.

46
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,435
But every now and again you come across
a signature that is unmistakable.

47
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,076
A fish the size of a sardine.

48
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,679
A shrimp, even its antennae perfectly preserved.

49
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,399
One of those pioneering dragonflies,
nearly six inches across.

50
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,358
And a pterosaur with skinny wings
and teeth in its jaws.

51
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,516
With so many superb fossils,

52
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,430
people thought that they had
a complete list of the visitors to the lagoon.

53
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,995
And then, in the middle of the last century,

54
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,877
a signature was discovered that was
wholly unexpected and totally amazing.

55
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,470
This is it. It's a feather.

56
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,399
Its barbs are narrower on one side of the quill,

57
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,354
just as they are on the feathers
of a modern bird's wing.

58
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,955
This asymmetry is a sure sign
that such feathers were used for flight.

59
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,959
But what animal at the time of the dinosaurs
could have such a wing?

60
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,755
The answer was found
the very next year in the same quarry:

61
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,351
a fossil with its feathers still attached to its body.

62
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,956
This is archaeopteryx.

63
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,714
It had three toes armed with claws
and long, strong legs.

64
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,549
Clearly it walked and perched like a bird.

65
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,469
But its head was very reptilian with bony jaws.

66
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,193
And in those jaws, teeth.

67
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,588
Its spine was extended into a bony tail,
again like that of a reptile.

68
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,917
But on either side of the tail bones,
clearly visible,

69
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,432
it had those characteristic possessions of birds:
feathers.

70
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,869
Feathers are made of keratin, as are the scales
that many birds still have on their legs,

71
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,548
and reptiles all over their body.

72
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,276
A scaly coat must be very hot,
so reptiles, like this skink,

73
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,836
have to seek shade
during the hottest part of the day.

74
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,236
But if the scales became fibrous, they could be
fluffed up to let in cooling air during the day,

75
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,433
and closed down to trap insulating air
for warmth at night.

76
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,758
So it is not difficult to believe that scales
eventually became transformed into feathers.

77
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:27,637
But why should they have become so long
that they enabled the animal to take to the air?

78
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,549
Well, this Australian lizard suggests an answer.

79
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:38,871
When it is threatened by its enemies, it responds
by spreading the great frill it has around its neck.

80
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,633
But if that doesn't scare them off,
it runs away, on its hind legs.

81
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,915
If such a reptile had developed feathery scales
on its forelegs and then spread them out

82
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,478
then it might easily lift into the air
and so escape a land-bound predator.

83
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,756
There's another possibility.
Maybe that early reptile did not live on the ground

84
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:15,229
but climbed in the trees searching for food,
as today the little flying lizard of Borneo does.

85
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,318
It now glides from tree to tree.

86
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,877
It has developed wings that are flaps of skin
supported by elongated ribs.

87
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:38,750
If that early enterprising reptile with feathery
scales did have specially long ones on its arms,

88
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,873
then they too would have enabled it
to glide from tree to tree.

89
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,833
Maybe its arm muscles were even strong enough

90
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,272
to allow it to make a few flaps
to help it on its way.

91
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,116
Archaeopteryx was certainly
well-equipped for climbing,

92
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,279
for its wings still carried three fingers,
each ending with a hooked claw,

93
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,550
ideal for clinging on to twigs.

94
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,558
And there are birds today with very similar ones

95
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,548
that give a clear hint as to how
it might have used them.

96
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,992
These are young hoatzin, sitting on their nest
in a South American swamp,

97
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,952
still guarded by their parents.

98
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,072
A hoatzin chick has an adventurous disposition

99
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,909
and starts clambering about
when it's only a few days old.

100
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,516
The hooks on its front limbs are obviously
very useful in keeping it secure

101
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,395
until such a time as they become
feathered and reliable wings.

102
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,275
One can imagine that archaeopteryx used them
in much the same way

103
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,914
and for much the same reason.

104
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,037
Sometimes, however, there's a disaster.

105
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,357
There are dangerous reptiles in the swamp:
snakes and caiman.

106
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,030
But those claws on the wings
are once again invaluable.

107
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,196
Mother returns. She has been
feeding on leaves and will have a full crop.

108
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,994
Maybe there will be some for the chick.

109
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,198
The hoatzin, of course, like all modern birds,

110
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,190
doesn't have bony jaws with teeth
like archaeopteryx, but a lightweight beak.

111
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,198
When did that important change take place?

112
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,234
Well, this fossilised bird has a beak,
and it was found in China recently.

113
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,197
It's only a little younger than archaeopteryx,
so it seems that the change took place quickly.

114
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,119
And it must have made flight much more efficient

115
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,553
for it prevented a bird from being nose-heavy
and significantly reduced its overall weight.

116
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,397
By 50 million years ago,
the dynasty of birds was firmly established.

117
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,229
At that time, a great lake
lay here in Central Germany.

118
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,390
It's long since dried out, and the layers of mud
from its floor have turned into shales.

119
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,560
Excavations like the one that's going on here

120
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,117
have revealed
just how varied the birds had become.

121
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,995
This one has been set in yellow resin
to make its details quite clear.

122
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,270
It had a horny beak,

123
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:45,353
a fully feathered wing, a long feathered tail
with no bony support and long legs.

124
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,597
It probably looked like a rail

125
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,670
0ther fossils from these shales show that several
families of modern birds were already established.

126
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,839
This was a water bird,
possibly an ancestor of today's jacana.

127
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,795
It would have found plenty of insects
among the floating leaves on the lake.

128
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,877
There were birds with powerful chisel-like bills,
perhaps woodpeckers,

129
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:18,189
that even in this early period had
started excavating insects from trees nearby.

130
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,593
Another inhabitant of those prehistoric woods
had a stubbier, more all-purpose beak,

131
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,916
rather like finches do today.

132
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:38,478
There were tall birds with long powerful legs
that hunted for small reptiles on the ground

133
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,478
as the South American seriama does.

134
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,878
And there was a gigantic vulture
with a wingspan of over 20 feet,

135
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,833
bigger even than that of the Andean condor

136
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,591
and probably the biggest flying bird
that has ever existed.

137
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,756
There were even birds
which, judging from their skeletons,

138
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,750
were as agile in the air as their
probable descendants, the frigate birds.

139
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:25,799
So by 50 million years ago, several families
of modern birds were well established.

140
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,113
The rule of the reptiles was now really over.

141
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,517
Not only had pterosaurs
disappeared from the skies,

142
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,272
dinosaurs had gone from the ground.
So the dominance of the land was up for grabs.

143
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,792
There were two contenders:
the mammals and the birds.

144
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,391
The biggest mammal to be found
from this lake in Germany was a primitive horse.

145
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,477
It was no bigger than a spaniel

146
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,638
But the biggest bird was very different.

147
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,354
That was the lower part of its beak,

148
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,393
and this was the upper.

149
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,552
If its skeleton still lay here,
you would have to dig a huge pit to extract it.

150
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,274
This bird was immense.

151
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,315
It has been named, with good reason,
the terror bird.

152
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,037
Its wings were tiny
but it had long and powerful legs.

153
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,236
Flightless birds of a comparable size still exist

154
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,319
and can give us some idea
of what it looked like.

155
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:58,072
This, the ostrich, is
the biggest and heaviest bird alive today.

156
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:04,310
It is probably not closely related to those
monstrous feathered hunters of prehistory,

157
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,355
but together with the emu of Australia
and the rhea of South America,

158
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:15,954
it belongs to a very ancient family of birds
that abandoned flight a very long time ago.

159
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,197
It relies for its defence on speed

160
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:29,111
and, in the interests of its efficiency as a runner,
its toes have been reduced to two.

161
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,108
If pursued, it can sprint at over 40 miles an hour.

162
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,956
But although it is now flightless,

163
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:51,429
it still has many of the physical characters
evolved by its ancestors that enabled them to fly.

164
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,268
It still has feathers
and they are still placed on its wings

165
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,837
in much the same position
as those on the wings of a flying bird.

166
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,519
But they are now useless for flight.

167
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,438
Their filaments have lost their hooks

168
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,519
so they can no longer
be zipped together into an unbroken blade.

169
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,314
Instead they are loose and fluffy.

170
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,274
Their only function now is as insulating blankets,

171
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,632
to keep out the cold at night
and the heat during the day.

172
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,238
0striches have become grazers,
the bird equivalent of antelope or horses.

173
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,076
But unlike them, they not only pick up leaves.

174
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,593
They swallow all kinds of other things as well,
and for a very good reason.

175
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,474
Just as they inherited feathers
from their flying ancestors,

176
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:00,950
so they also inherited a lightweight, horny beak
instead of a heavy jaw laden with teeth.

177
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,075
And without teeth, they need
another way to grind up their food.

178
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,476
A pebble can help them do just that.

179
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,748
Down it goes into a muscular compartment
of the stomach, the gizzard,

180
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:27,911
a kind of mill where bits of vegetation are churned
around and ground into a digestible pulp.

181
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,031
But while some birds were abandoning flight,

182
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,835
some mammals
were becoming formidable hunters.

183
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,310
0striches with their superb eyesight and tall necks

184
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,479
are able to keep a sharp lookout
for approaching danger.

185
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,318
The cheetah has to calculate very carefully
whether it's worthwhile chasing something...

186
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,992
..and an ostrich, usually, is not.
It is so very fast, and even if it's caught,

187
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,637
it has little meat on it
compared with a similar sized mammal

188
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,073
But birds that can't run
are a tempting target for hunters everywhere.

189
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,949
If they couldn't fly, they wouldn't last long.

190
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,071
Flight has certainly enabled birds
to colonise the entire globe.

191
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,670
But the compulsion
that drove them into the air in the first place,

192
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,476
and has certainly kept most of them there
ever since, was probably safety.

193
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,195
Even so, the cost of flying is high.

194
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,954
Flapping wings takes a lot of effort

195
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,233
and if there is no need to do so,
birds save their energies.

196
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,797
Those that live here on the Galapagos Islands,
isolated in the Pacific,

197
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,348
have no natural enemies from which to escape,
so some birds don't bother to fly.

198
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,631
Have a look at these cormorants, for example.

199
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:05,598
At first sight, they look like many another
cormorant sitting on cliffs round the world.

200
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,515
But these wings are stunted and tattered.

201
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,636
This bird could never get into the air.

202
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,674
Its feathers now serve only
to keep it warm in the water.

203
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,668
It's for that reason alone
that it keeps them well-oiled.

204
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,112
It is scarcely any better at walking
than it is at flying.

205
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,155
0nce in the water, however,
it's a very efficient mover indeed.

206
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,714
The position of its legs right at the back
of its body that made it so clumsy on land

207
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,356
is ideal for propelling
it through the water at speed

208
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,155
and helps it to catch all the fish it needs.

209
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,515
For the Galapagos cormorant,
flight has become an irrelevance.

210
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,553
0ther island birds have reacted in a similar way.

211
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:50,676
This is New Caledonia in the western Pacific,
and this is its special bird, the kagu.

212
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,395
Its ancestors must certainly have
arrived here by air,

213
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,593
but since New Caledonia had
no ground predators until recently,

214
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:04,555
they gave up flying
and today the kagu is virtually flightless.

215
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,796
It finds all its food
on the ground in the leaf litter.

216
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,915
It's been here so long that it's difficult to be sure
exactly who its ancestors were,

217
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,634
but they were probably herons.

218
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,551
Rails are a very widespread family of birds.

219
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,275
Wherever there is a big swamp,
you are likely to find one.

220
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,076
0n the continents, they tend to lurk shyly
in the undergrowth to keep out of trouble.

221
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,751
But some, somehow, have also managed
to reach a great number of islands

222
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,236
and there they seem to have no fear at all.

223
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,159
This one, it's a weka,

224
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:06,356
has also become flightless
because of its isolation on an island.

225
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,233
But its island is immense.

226
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,390
It's 1,000 miles long, if you discount
a narrow arm of sea that crosses it in the middle,

227
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,674
and it contains mountains over 12,000 feet high;
it's New Zealand.

228
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,950
The first land-living mammals
to get here were human beings

229
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,755
and they didn't arrive until a mere 1500 years ago.

230
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,430
So here you can still glimpse
what the world would have been like

231
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,077
if the birds had won that battle with
the early mammals and now ruled the earth,

232
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,033
for here they once did.

233
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,758
Many of New Zealand's birds
flew here from Australia,

234
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,032
15,000 miles away
across the sea to the west.

235
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,314
They started to do so millions of years ago,
and they are still doing so today.

236
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,116
So if you know Australian birds,
you will recognise quite a lot,

237
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,199
particularly those that are relatively recent arrivals.

238
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,995
The New Zealand pigeon is not
all that much different from Australian ones.

239
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,711
The saddleback, on the other hand, must have
been established here for much longer

240
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,471
for it has changed so much that no one is
quite sure what family it belongs to.

241
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,071
The tui has similarly mysterious origins.

242
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:49,231
No other bird has a costume to compare with
its lacy cape and that little white throat bobble.

243
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,114
The kaka is clearly a parrot.
There are lots of parrots in Australia

244
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,235
so it's not surprising that some of them
in the past should have found their way here.

245
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,679
Most of these birds have still not learned
that mammals are dangerous.

246
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,230
This saddleback is a fully wild bird
and certainly hasn't seen me before.

247
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,159
But look how trusting it is.

248
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,676
This is a New Zealand robin.

249
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,000
It's no relation to the European robin
and, if anything, it's even braver.

250
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,308
The New Zealand bush is full of food,
of one kind or another.

251
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,954
And as the birds once had it all to themselves,

252
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:02,599
some were able to adopt diets and ways of life
that elsewhere were claimed by mammals.

253
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:09,148
The kokako eats much the same thing
as squirrels: fruit and leaves and insects.

254
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,389
European squirrels run along the branches.

255
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:24,631
Asian squirrels, using a skinny parachute stretched
between their legs, are able to glide as well.

256
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,789
And that is very much how the kokako
gets around in the trees.

257
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,955
Having glided down to the lower branches,
it runs back up them

258
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,072
and jumps from one to the other.

259
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:20,630
So if the kokako, up in the trees, feeds in the
same way as a squirrel might do,

260
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,116
what lives and feeds
like a mammal on the ground?

261
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,676
The leaf litter in these forests
is full of food of one kind or another.

262
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,431
There are earthworms and insects
and beetle larvae.

263
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,155
In any other land
there would be some small native mammal

264
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,193
that was burrowing around seeking that food.

265
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,076
But not here in New Zealand.
Here there's something quite different.

266
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,518
You will only see it after dark.

267
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,668
It is, of course, a bird,
but what an extraordinary one. The kiwi.

268
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,750
It's territorial and calls stridently
to proclaim its ownership.

269
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:33,152
It finds its prey by smell,
uniquely its nostrils are on the tip of its beak.

270
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,439
It's found a worm.

271
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,672
But once it drops it,
its eyesight is so poor that it can't see it

272
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,031
and it has to smell for it, with its beak.

273
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:01,957
Its tiny vestigial wings are invisible, buried in
its plumage and it has lost all sign of a tail

274
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,117
If the kiwis live in
a patch of forest close by the sea,

275
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:15,316
then in the evening they may come down
on to the beach to look for these:

276
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:22,117
Sandhoppers. They love them.
And that will give us a chance, a rare chance,

277
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,118
to see them out in the open.

278
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,995
To do so properly, we have to use
our special starlight camera.

279
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,951
The kiwi is hunting along the strand line

280
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,517
where there are lots of hoppers
feeding on the decaying seaweed.

281
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,155
Its sense of smell is so acute
it can pick out the largest juiciest hoppers

282
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,318
deep in the sand without even seeing them.

283
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,349
0ur starlight camera
can see much better than I can.

284
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:18,795
I need a torch to see this extraordinary creature
properly, but it doesn't seem to mind.

285
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,875
Its feathers are just filaments,

286
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,835
so that it almost looks as though it is
covered with coarse fur.

287
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:49,389
Probing sand with your nostrils is all very well,
but it does clog them up,

288
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,559
and so you need to blow them clear
every now and then.

289
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,992
It's nocturnal and furry:
It finds its way around by smell.

290
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:17,912
It lives in holes and digs for worms and grubs.
It's a bird equivalent of a badger.

291
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,472
But there's plenty of other food to be found
in the New Zealand bush.

292
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:34,116
Here on the forest floor, there are lots of leaves.

293
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,359
They may be a bit twiggy and coarse
but they are food nonetheless.

294
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,949
What could have browsed on these?

295
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:48,034
Well,  not far from here,
bones like this have been dug up.

296
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,958
It's obviously a leg-bone,

297
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:55,314
and at first sight you might think it
was a leg-bone of a mammal, say perhaps, a cow.

298
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,958
But when you look at it closely you can see
that it's got a honeycomb structure.

299
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,878
It's a bird bone,

300
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:10,236
but the bone of a very big bird indeed,
as we know from the rest of its skeleton.

301
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,590
It had just three toes.

302
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,193
Its pelvis and its spine
lead up to an extraordinarily long neck.

303
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,632
This bird stood over six feet, two metres tall.

304
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:46,548
The first human settlers on these islands
saw these giants alive and called them moas.

305
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:53,438
Among them were the tallest birds that ever
existed, that weighed over 200 kilos, 400lbs.

306
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,668
There were about a dozen different species
of varying size and weight.

307
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,394
Up on the high moorlands, there were smaller
species with thicker feathers to keep them warm.

308
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,878
The absence of mammals
didn't mean that the moas had no enemies.

309
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,834
They were hunted by, of course, another bird.

310
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,430
An immense eagle
that could manoeuvre through the patchy forest.

311
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,839
The only prey that was abundant enough
to sustain such a giant were other birds

312
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,556
and it's probable that
it was able to tackle even the biggest moa.

313
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,878
Its talons were certainly long enough
to stab right through a moa's flesh

314
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:01,153
and into its pelvis, as some of the bones show.

315
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,950
Nevertheless, the moas survived
for a million years or more

316
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,754
and spread all over New Zealand.

317
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,839
But eventually mammals
did reach these remote islands.

318
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,478
Apart from bats which flew here, the first to arrive
were those most dangerous of all,

319
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,272
human beings.

320
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,032
They hunted the moas for meat
and soon they had hunted them to extinction.

321
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:32,349
But a different kind of flightless bird
does still survive, up in these high mountains.

322
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,479
Like so many of New Zealand's native birds
that had abandoned flight,

323
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,470
it had no defence against the alien mammals
that Europeans brought with them

324
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,148
and that soon escaped and ran wild.

325
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:54,754
Rats ate their eggs and killed the chicks,
and cats and stoats massacred the adults.

326
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,796
There was a giant flightless coot
that was originally very common.

327
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,913
But it got scarcer and scarcer
and by the middle of the nineteenth century,

328
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,032
it was thought to be totally extinct.

329
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,754
And then, just 50 years ago,

330
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,877
someone in these remote valleys
found something like this.

331
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,198
This is the dropping of a takahe

332
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,509
and here, the severed stems
of tussock grass on which it's been feeding.

333
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,676
It's still here.

334
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,510
And here is her nest.

335
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:55,474
She's sitting tight, hiding her brilliant red bill
so that she is not conspicuous.

336
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,392
Indeed, when only
her lovely moss-green back is visible,

337
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:15,914
she is well camouflaged from her only
native enemy, a bird of prey, circling overhead.

338
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:23,433
0nly about forty pairs of takahe
survive today in the wild.

339
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,076
So the eggs she is sitting on are very precious.

340
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,558
This high country was probably not
the takahe's original home.

341
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,548
Most of the population in the last century
lived at lower altitudes

342
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,436
and there they had lush vegetation to feed on
in the warm swamps.

343
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,076
But most of those were drained
and turned into farmland.

344
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:50,230
So now these high empty valleys,
only recently scraped down to the rock by glaciers,

345
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:56,595
are the takahe's last refuge and there is
little to eat up here, except tussock grass.

346
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,156
Extracting something nutritious
from tussock is not easy.

347
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:25,469
The takahe's technique is to pull up a whole stem
and then nibble just the bottom inch or so.

348
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,148
That's where most minerals and sugars are

349
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,319
and it's the only bit
tender enough to be easily cut.

350
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,719
At first the chick doesn't know
how to do this and has to be fed.

351
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,230
It will stay with its parent for a whole year.

352
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:58,390
0nly then will it be strong enough
and skilled enough to feed entirely by itself.

353
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,755
Now it's summer, but when winter comes,
life will be even tougher.

354
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,192
Then the pools freeze over
and the tussock has no fresh shoots,

355
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,278
even if they could be reached beneath the snow.

356
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,349
Then the takahe is reduced to digging for tubers
in the freezing earth.

357
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:27,511
So the birds' continued survival up in these
barren moorlands is by no means assured.

358
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,599
One other flightless bird found refuge
from mammals in these high mountains;

359
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,156
and in many ways,
it was the most extraordinary of all.

360
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,557
It was a giant parrot, the kakapo.

361
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,150
It lived in very much the same way as rabbits do.

362
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:52,959
It created tracks through its territory
generation after generation, trudging along here

363
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:59,713
and feeding by plucking these grasses
and eating the succulent base.

364
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,911
This particular path runs under this bush

365
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:08,636
and continues upwards
along the highest edge of this narrow ridge.

366
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,036
The track leads to this shallow bowl,

367
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,153
and there are others like it
spaced out along the track.

368
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:33,071
They were excavated by the male kakapo
whose territory this was.

369
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,955
He would dig them out;
and then in the night, he would come here

370
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:43,269
and, crouching low, make a deep booming call
which echoed out across these valleys,

371
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,790
summoning the females to come to him.

372
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,709
But there were no females
seen after the 1970s up here.

373
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,471
One lone male continued
trudging up here and calling.

374
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:04,391
But in vain.
And in 1985, his call was heard no more.

375
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,438
And then when hope was almost gone,

376
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:18,510
a new population of kakapos was discovered
on the southernmost island, Stewart Island.

377
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,190
They too were being harried by cats and stoats,

378
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,838
so the survivors were caught
and taken to three small cat-free islets.

379
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:34,036
There were only 61 of them.
The kakapo's survival was on a knife-edge.

380
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:52,118
A male, after slumbering all day in his burrow,
emerges for his evening meal

381
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,039
His hearing is acute, he listens for danger.

382
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:26,198
He's following his regular track that will lead him
to the highest slopes of his mountain.

383
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:40,229
A female has clambered up into the top
of the bushes, looking for fresh shoots and fruit.

384
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:47,239
Her dappled green plumage
camouflages her against attacks from falcons,

385
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,993
but even so, she won't dare to venture
into the topmost branches until it's dark.

386
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:05,118
Nightfall, and now we need our starlight camera
to see what's happening.

387
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:14,510
By midnight the male has plodded his way
right to the summit of his mountain.

388
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:25,789
He has reached one of his bowls from which
his calls could echo out over the valley below.

389
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,077
He begins to tidy it up.

390
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,236
The female has found
what she wants up in the branches.

391
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:45,230
She will need all the most nourishing food
she can find if she is to produce an egg.

392
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,158
Even at the best of times,

393
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:52,832
she will not be able to accumulate
enough bodily reserves to lay every year.

394
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,559
The male begins to inflate air-sacs on his chest

395
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:09,950
that will act as resonators and so amplify his calls,
sending them booming out across the valley.

396
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,636
There are probably
only 12 fertile female kakapos left alive.

397
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:05,038
In the first 10 years after they were moved
to the safety of their new homes,

398
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,870
only three chicks were reared.
But then in the last two seasons,

399
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,993
seven young kakapo were successfully hatched.

400
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:19,354
Maybe the species will come back
from the brink of extinction after all.

401
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:31,160
0f course, only a minority of New Zealand's birds
have become flightless.

402
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,238
Most, like these handsome spotted shags,

403
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:40,356
have retained that characteristic talent of birds,
the ability to travel by air,

404
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:45,031
and worldwide, birds have exploited that ability
to an extraordinary degree.

405
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,392
Some can make journeys of over a thousand miles
without coming down to earth.

406
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,195
Some can fly to altitudes of over 25,000 feet.

407
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,960
Some can even fly backwards.

408
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,359
How they manage to get into the air
and sustain themselves there

409
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,711
is what we will
be looking at in the next programme.
