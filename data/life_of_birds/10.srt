
2
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,312
The desolate wastes of the Antarctic -

3
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,796
so cold that insects would freeze solid.

4
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,390
Volcanic springs in Africa -
spouting water so hot and corrosive

5
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,637
that it will strip skin from flesh.

6
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,196
The waterless deserts of the tropics -

7
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,153
hundreds of square miles of baking sand.

8
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,432
The earth can be an inhospitable place,

9
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,790
yet birds of some kind

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,629
manage somehow to endure
and survive all its privations.

11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,593
Indeed, there is scarcely a corner of the globe

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,189
that birds have not colonised.

13
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,870
Sandgrouse live in the sandy deserts of Africa,

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,197
as barren a landscape as you can imagine.

15
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,756
Yet hidden in these sands are tiny seeds.

16
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,679
They were shed by plants months or years ago

17
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,997
after a storm briefly dampened the desert.

18
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,760
The sandgrouse, by searching incessantly,

19
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,919
manage to pick out several thousand every day.

20
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,558
But they have to drink.

21
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,832
Waterholes are few and far between
in this desert,

22
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,478
and some birds may have to fly for as much
as 50 miles before they find one.

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,432
And when they get there,

24
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,633
all it is is a little puddle
like this one in front of me.

25
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,712
After such a long flight, their thirst is huge.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,073
But some must do more
than satisfy their own needs.

27
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,191
They have left behind them,

28
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,233
away in the desert, their newly-hatched chicks.

29
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,914
Chicks can't fly,
but they too must have water....

30
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,470
and the males will take it to them.

31
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,557
They can't carry it in their crops.

32
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,069
They'll need all that water to sustain themselves.

33
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,874
But they have extra tanks.

34
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,713
Their breast feathers have a special adaptation.

35
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,797
They're covered on their inner sides

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,154
with a mat of filaments so fine
that they absorb water like blotting paper.

37
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,354
And then they're off again
on the long return flight.

38
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,354
A female is waiting for her mate.

39
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,429
It's roastingly hot,
and with her are her chicks.

40
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,156
Here he comes,
and the female makes way for him.

41
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,438
While the last chick struggles from its shell,

42
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,269
the others cluster around
and suck from his breast,

43
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,916
for all the world like puppies or kittens.

44
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,719
So one comparatively
small adaptation of its feathers

45
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,708
has enabled the sandgrouse
to colonise a corner of the world

46
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,309
closed to others.

47
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,675
The ground in the wake
of one of the bush fires

48
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,394
that regularly sweep
across the grasslands of Africa

49
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,195
seems initially just as parched
as its deserts.

50
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,039
Yet the courser, a relative of the plover's,

51
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,471
is a nomad who actually seeks it out.

52
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,195
Insects killed by the smoke
and flames are easily collected.

53
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,436
So it has some attractions.

54
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,428
Yet it is also here that it chooses to nest.

55
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,994
This must be a long-standing habit,

56
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,115
for its eggs are camouflaged
to match the incinerated earth.

57
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,880
Since all the scrub has been cleared by fire,

58
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,870
the bird has the advantage
of being able to see approaching predators.

59
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,992
Dawn on the shores of the Persian Gulf,

60
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,272
and crab plovers,
having fed on the edge of the sea,

61
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,311
come back to their breeding grounds.

62
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,349
It will soon be so hot
that the sand will be painful to touch.

63
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,993
Yet this is where the crab plovers choose to nest.

64
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,239
Every other plover in the world lays its eggs
in a simple scrape in the ground.

65
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,795
But not these.

66
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,150
They, in spite of their unsuitably long legs,

67
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,954
have learned how to become burrowers.

68
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,392
They've discovered that,
only a few inches below the surface,

69
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,830
the sand is wonderfully cool

70
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,873
There, a bird can sit on its eggs in comfort

71
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,117
throughout the crushing heat of the day.

72
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,718
To feed, the plovers have to go down
to the edge of the sea.

73
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,755
There, they can keep cool by bathing.

74
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,549
The African Rift Valley offers no such relief.

75
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,348
This steaming-hot water
comes from volcanic springs

76
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,632
and is so loaded with soda
that around the margins of the lake

77
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,354
it solidifies into white curds.

78
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,677
Yet flamingos come here in thousands.

79
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,433
The attraction? The salty,
tepid water is full of algae

80
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,757
and small crustaceans
which the birds can collect,

81
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,078
using their specialised beaks
like filter pumps.

82
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,875
The fact that so few creatures
can tolerate these conditions

83
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,991
means that any animal that can

84
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,910
has the place to itself
and so can proliferate in vast numbers.

85
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,317
That applies to the crustaceans
and the algae in the water

86
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,149
and also to the birds that feed on them.

87
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,831
For the birds, there is an additional attraction.

88
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,350
The soda-rich waters are so caustic

89
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,792
that hunters such as hyenas, lions or smaller cats
won't wade through them,

90
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,391
so the centre of the lake
is one of the safest places for a nest.

91
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,634
The flamingos pile the mud into mounds

92
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,719
just high enough to be clear
of any salt spray blown by the wind.

93
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,992
That, if it caked the eggs, would kill them.

94
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,554
But the heat is so extreme,

95
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,830
the congealed soda so caustic,

96
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,749
that sometimes a whole generation is lost.

97
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,157
Nonetheless, the success rate is still sufficient

98
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,113
to maintain the size of the flocks.

99
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,673
This white desert is also hostile to life,

100
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,793
but for a very different reason.

101
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,551
The crust that I am walking on is not soda.

102
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,278
It's snow and ice, and that too
causes huge difficulties for birds.

103
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,559
Here in the Arctic, during the winter,

104
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,117
such things that are edible
are locked away beneath the snow and ice.

105
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,598
Nonetheless, a few birds manage
to survive through this bleak season,

106
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,631
provided they get help...

107
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,356
..from polar bears.

108
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,311
The bears will eat almost every part
of a seal, their staple diet.

109
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,636
But they leave enough from their kills

110
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,799
to provide scavenging gulls with a meal

111
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,352
In summer, on the tundra,

112
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,279
it's warm enough for plants to grow in the lakes.

113
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,950
There, spectacled eider duck swim and dive

114
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,152
to collect insect larvae and worms
from the muddy bottom.

115
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,188
But when winter comes,
the lakes freeze and then the ducks vanish.

116
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,551
Until very recently, no one knew where they went.

117
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,991
The answer was found in 1995.

118
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,156
Hundreds of miles from the coast,

119
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,798
they gather together on the surface of the sea,
surrounded by ice.

120
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,755
There are no more
than half a dozen such assemblies

121
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,919
and between them they contain
the entire world population

122
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,588
of the spectacled eider.

123
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,633
The birds are so tightly packed
and so continuously on the move

124
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,231
that, within their huge pond,
the water does not freeze over.

125
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,796
They can dive to collect food
from the bottom of the Arctic 0cean

126
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,831
200 feet below;

127
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,556
food that would otherwise
be denied them by the sea ice.

128
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,312
In the Antarctic,
at the other end of the globe,

129
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,954
the winter can be even more severe.

130
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,118
Temperatures can fall
to 80 degrees below zero

131
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,232
and the gales blow at over 100 miles an hour.

132
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,878
Yet this is the time the biggest of all penguins,
the Emperors, have to breed.

133
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,355
Having mated at the beginning of the winter,

134
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,030
the females return to the sea,
leaving the eggs with the males,

135
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,313
who hold them on top of their feet
to keep them off the ice.

136
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,109
Emperors are so big that there is not time
in the short Antarctic summer

137
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,959
for the chicks to grow
into sea-going adults.

138
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,199
So breeding must start
before the winter sets in.

139
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,798
The males cannot feed for four months.

140
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,309
Then the females will return,

141
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,513
allowing the males
to go down to the sea for a meal

142
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,030
Meanwhile, in the continuous
darkness of mid-winter,

143
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,310
broken only by the Southern Lights,

144
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,149
all the male Emperors can do is endure.

145
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,637
The darkness perhaps
doesn't trouble them unduly.

146
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,274
Penguins, after all, don't fly.

147
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,072
But most birds do,

148
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,158
and they rely on their sight
in order to navigate.

149
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,557
So, for them,
darkness is a major problem,

150
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,116
and no darkness
is more complete than in a cave.

151
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,198
This is the Caripe Cavern in Venezuela.

152
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,595
(TREMEND0US DIN)

153
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,032
And here there is no
natural light whatsoever,

154
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,438
and yet, as I can hear
from this deafening chorus of calls,

155
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,518
there is a huge population of birds here.

156
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,439
How can they see to fly?

157
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,235
Well, we have with us
some very, very dim lights

158
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,716
and an extremely sensitive low-light camera.

159
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,876
So if I turn this out...

160
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,990
I can't see anything at all,

161
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,395
and presumably the birds can't either.

162
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,160
But, hopefully, you can.

163
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,156
These are oil birds.

164
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,949
They're related to nightjars,
and like them have large eyes

165
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,597
that help them fly
by the light of the moon and stars.

166
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,349
But in the depths of caves,
even eyes like this are of no help.

167
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,154
Instead, the birds navigate by sound.

168
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,549
Their raucous social calls

169
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,797
are augmented
by high-pitched rattling sounds.

170
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,672
The echoes produced by these

171
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,668
enable the birds to visualise
their surroundings so well

172
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,553
that they can unfailingly
find their own nest.

173
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,716
In the evening, they fly out
into the comparative brightness

174
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,718
of the starry sky to feed.

175
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,351
They seek out the fruit of palms and laurels

176
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,758
which have a strong fragrance, so the oil birds
are able to find them by smell.

177
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,158
They are now in no danger
of being attacked by hawks,

178
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,796
as they would've been
if they had not spent the day

179
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,560
in the safety of their cave.

180
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,280
So all over the world, birds,

181
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,313
by changing their habits
or adapting their anatomy,

182
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,274
manage to survive
in the most hostile of places.

183
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,475
A century ago, a completely new kind
of environment appeared on earth.

184
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,274
Nothing like it had faced the birds before

185
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,836
in their entire 200 million years history.

186
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,158
Yet some species began
to adapt to it almost immediately.

187
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,955
This is it, the modern city.

188
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,716
Sao Paulo in Brazil -

189
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,913
a wilderness of glass and brick,
concrete and steel

190
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,193
And circling among
the skyscrapers...black vultures.

191
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,790
There are plenty of ledges
on these man-made cliffs

192
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,752
to serve as nest sites,

193
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,669
and the vultures have
little hesitation in using them.

194
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,356
(P0RTUGUESE FR0M NEARBY RADI0)

195
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:11,833
This devoted parent has brought back
a crop-load to feed its chicks.

196
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,354
The adults have little difficulty
in finding all the food they need

197
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,711
for themselves and their young.

198
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,228
There is, literally, tons of it around.

199
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,396
A short flight away,
on the outskirts of the city,

200
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,195
the rotting leftovers
of a million meals are dumped daily,

201
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,313
mixed with inedible refuse of all kinds,
some of it actively poisonous.

202
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,633
Not many birds have either
the temperament to tolerate such places

203
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,196
or the digestion to cope with such food.

204
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,355
But those that have, swarm in huge numbers

205
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,870
like flamingos on an African soda lake.

206
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,631
In the same way, when farmers bring
industrial methods into agriculture

207
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,958
and devote huge fields
to raising just one particular crop

208
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,039
and it particularly suits
the taste of one particular bird,

209
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,597
that bird will turn up
in huge numbers to feast on it.

210
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,515
Waxwings.

211
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,431
They love these blueberries
ripening in plantations in Florida,

212
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,712
so they come in thousands
to collect them.

213
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,388
If these assemblies reach plague proportions,

214
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,990
then that is no more
than a reflection of the intensive way

215
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,839
in which man grows his crops.

216
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,919
Few other birds can manage to eat
these large cultivated blueberries

217
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,638
and indeed, even waxwings sometimes
have a little trouble in doing so.

218
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,152
Crows have become highly skilled
at making a living

219
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,590
in these new urban environments.

220
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,756
In this Japanese city,

221
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,794
they have devised a way of eating
a food that normally they can't manage.

222
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,238
Dropping a nut
from a great height onto a hard road

223
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,476
does, sometimes, crack it.

224
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,638
But some nuts are particularly tough.

225
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,110
So the crows have devised a better way.

226
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,713
Drop it among the traffic.

227
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,271
The problem now is collecting
the bits without getting run over.

228
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,554
So some birds
have refined their technique.

229
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,390
They station themselves
beside pedestrian crossings...

230
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,714
..wait for the lights
to stop the traffic...

231
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,956
..then collect your cracked nut
in safety.

232
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,834
City life may offer birds attractions

233
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,270
that are rather less obvious
than just food.

234
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,679
This is the centre of Glasgow,
5 o'clock on an autumn evening.

235
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,758
For half an hour, thousands of starlings

236
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,748
put on a spectacular display
of formation flying

237
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,428
over the darkening city.

238
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,839
Why they do this we don't really know.

239
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,511
Maybe it is to get to know one another,
creating some kind of team spirit,

240
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,439
for they tend to spend
the winter in parties.

241
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,631
Maybe it's because
there is safety in numbers

242
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,276
when trying to avoid predators
such as hawks.

243
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,150
When it's too dark for aerobatics,
they come in to roost.

244
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,994
Such assemblies
may be information centres.

245
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,112
Birds that fed well today
will head back tomorrow

246
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,231
to where they know there is food.

247
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,476
And the hungry ones will follow them.

248
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,509
Here in Europe,
towns are also attractive

249
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,996
because it is a little warmer
than out in the countryside.

250
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,588
You might think that
this is just about the last place

251
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,315
that a bird or any other animal
would choose to sleep.

252
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,354
This is an oil refinery
on the banks of the Amazon River

253
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,676
in central Brazil

254
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,192
Just across the water,
there's a lovely virgin rainforest,

255
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,949
yet here - well, just look and listen.

256
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,308
A fine mist of acrid droplets
stings your eyes.

257
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,592
The noise hurts your ears.

258
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,038
Yet promptly at 5 minutes
past 6 o'clock every evening,

259
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,356
there is an invasion.

260
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,398
Purple martins.

261
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,718
Stay still and they will settle
within inches of you.

262
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,230
Why they come here
in such numbers is a mystery.

263
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,590
It can hardly be that they seek warmth

264
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,837
in this muggy tropical atmosphere
of central Brazil

265
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,951
They don't feed here.

266
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,755
Perhaps it is because
there are fewer hawks around

267
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,428
to harry them than in the forest.

268
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,397
But whatever the reason,
come they do.

269
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,118
In March, however,

270
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,437
many of them will migrate north
to the United States,

271
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,229
and there they take up residence
in very different homes.

272
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,074
A small lakeside town

273
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,838
in Pennsylvania.

274
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,669
This luxury tower block

275
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,034
has accommodation for over
40 adults and 200 youngsters.

276
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,710
Each apartment
has all modern conveniences.

277
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,469
It can be wound down
regularly by the local people

278
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,878
and the shelf brought out
to make sure that the young are fit

279
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,629
and don't need help
with the housekeeping.

280
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,037
In fact, these apartments
are so luxurious

281
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,155
that these days, purple martins
don't nest in natural sites any more.

282
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,193
The purple martin has become totally dependent

283
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,231
on human beings.

284
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,430
It's said that the tradition was started

285
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,598
by the people native to this part of North America,

286
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,075
Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians,

287
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,557
who were glad to see the birds
when they arrived each spring

288
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,799
and hung out gourds to encourage them
to nest around their settlements.

289
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,629
Today, over a million people
in the United States

290
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,277
offer hospitality
to purple martins in this way.

291
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,238
It seems that those of us
who live in towns and cities

292
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,477
feel increasingly cut off
from the natural world

293
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,511
that lies beyond our buildings

294
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,110
and so we treasure any contact
we can find with wild creatures.

295
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,118
Certainly, an affection for birds is shared

296
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,394
by all kinds and conditions
of people all over the world.

297
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:31,236
In Arizona, Jesse Hendrix is
particularly devoted to hummingbirds.

298
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,997
His home lies
on the migration routes of several species.

299
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,760
The black-chinned
is one of the most common.

300
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,997
In spring they travel up from Mexico
on their way to nest

301
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,113
as far north
as Montana and British Columbia.

302
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,993
Then in autumn,
he sees them again on their way back

303
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,352
to their winter quarters
in the warmth of the south.

304
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,794
Some of them
have been fitted with leg-rings,

305
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,434
so he knows the same birds visit him each year

306
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,598
to drink from the same feeder.

307
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,951
It's possible that many now
vary their routes

308
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,312
to make sure that they pay a call
at such a reliable restaurant.

309
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,798
At the height of the migration,
he may be visited in a single day

310
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,912
by about 9,000 different birds.

311
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,911
And every day he provides his customers
with over 13 gallons of sugar water.

312
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,916
Meals like these must surely make
the difference between life and death

313
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,588
for many of the little rufous hummingbirds

314
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,109
which, on leaving Jesse's fuel station,

315
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,632
have still to tackle the last stage
of their 2,000-mile migration

316
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,671
across the Bay of Mexico

317
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,429
in one single 600-mile non-stop flight.

318
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,835
The very regularity and predictability of birds

319
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,917
can be part of their appeal

320
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,398
<i>..it is quite unpredictable. We can
never be terribly certain where...</i>

321
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,114
0n Philip Island, near Melbourne, Australia,

322
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,675
people come from all over the continent

323
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,997
to watch a regular evening parade.

324
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,318
Little penguins,
the smallest of the family.

325
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,918
They fish for pilchards and anchovies
out at sea during the day,

326
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,554
and every evening come ashore together

327
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,557
to return to their nest burrows,

328
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,435
following paths that have probably
been in use for thousands of years.

329
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,112
Scientists started to tag them
back in 1968.

330
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,710
It's the longest-running bird study
in the whole of Australia,

331
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,357
so by now they are well used
to being stared at.

332
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,550
Human beings over the last century

333
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,036
have built houses for themselves
along the penguins' beach,

334
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,754
but that hasn't deterred the birds.

335
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,714
Two half-grown chicks
are awaiting their evening meal

336
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,115
And the human residents
are only too delighted

337
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,278
to have such engaging lodgers
with regular habits

338
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,436
living beneath their front doorstep.

339
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,919
Humanity's impact
on the bird world, however,

340
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,793
has not always been so helpful

341
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,230
Birds reached all the islands
of the Pacific

342
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,510
a very long time before people did.

343
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,592
Small birds such as white-eyes
are not very powerful flyers,

344
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,553
but they probably made
the sea-crossings inadvertently,

345
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,910
carried by storms.

346
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,194
0nce on land, they and others,
like fantails, found insects to eat

347
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,359
which doubtless had made the journey
in the same sort of way.

348
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,870
Honeyeaters found plants in bloom
from which they could drink nectar.

349
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,117
And pigeons found fruit.

350
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,353
But when people sailed across the sea,
they brought animals

351
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,314
that by themselves could never
have made the journey.

352
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,875
This is the small island of Guam

353
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,074
that during the Second World War
became a major military base.

354
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,997
Some time in the 1940s,

355
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,033
brown tree snakes from New Guinea
appeared here,

356
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,993
brought accidentally by ships.

357
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,509
Tree snakes hunt birds,

358
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,840
and Guam's white-eyes, flycatchers
and fantails, having no experience of predators,

359
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,951
had no defence against them.

360
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,350
Today, Guam is an island without birds.

361
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,519
Species that evolved here
and differed from any elsewhere

362
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,517
have now gone for good.

363
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,589
Insects and spiders, without birds to keep
their numbers in check, have proliferated.

364
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,592
And the forests have fallen totally silent.

365
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,390
These New Zealand forests

366
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,830
have also been invaded by foreigners -

367
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,998
foreigners that have caused
great problems for the local birds

368
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,237
and, in particular, the kaka,
the local parrot.

369
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,716
These invaders
are surprisingly very small.

370
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:31,597
They are European wasps,
but their effects have been devastating.

371
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,956
Kakas eat a great deal of vegetable food -
fruit and seeds and nectar.

372
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,630
But they also feast on honeydew,

373
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,274
a sticky fluid excreted by insects

374
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,109
that live beneath the bark
of these trees, drinking sap.

375
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,198
Female kakas rely on this high-energy food

376
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,119
to bring them into breeding condition.

377
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:10,073
But the European wasps found honeydew
much to their taste as well.

378
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,431
The kakas are unable to compete,

379
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,633
and they are already under severe attack
from introduced predators such as stoats.

380
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,637
These latest insect invaders
may well be the final competitors

381
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,116
that eliminate the kaka
from these forests.

382
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,357
But the greatest destruction
of the world's birds

383
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,632
has been inflicted by human beings.

384
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,592
The huia, which once lived
in New Zealand's woodlands,

385
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,360
was hunted precisely because it was rare,

386
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,518
and was finally totally gone in 1907.

387
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,510
The great auk,
a giant flightless relation of the razorbill

388
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,359
that lived in the islands
of the north Atlantic,

389
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,111
was hunted and exterminated
by the middle of the nineteenth century.

390
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,393
The dodo, a pigeon that,
safe in its island sanctuary of Mauritius,

391
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,795
also evolved into a flightless giant,

392
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,117
was easy prey for hungry sailors.

393
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,676
They exterminated it
by the middle of the seventeenth century,

394
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,793
less than 200 years
after men first set foot on their island.

395
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,474
It's not only on islands
that birds are vulnerable

396
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,636
to changes brought by humanity.

397
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:35,595
150 years ago, prairies like this
in the United States were home

398
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,430
to flocks of birds
2 to 3,000 million strong.

399
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,279
They were so big
they darkened the skies

400
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,358
and took two or three days to pass.

401
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,996
They were what was probably
the most numerous bird

402
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,236
that has ever existed on earth -

403
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,795
passenger pigeons.

404
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,077
Their numbers were so astronomic

405
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,192
that no one considered them
as anything but pests,

406
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,949
nor could imagine that they would
ever be in danger of extinction.

407
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,358
But a combination of hunting and changes
to the landscape brought by farming

408
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,232
destroyed them.

409
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,632
The last wild passenger pigeon
was sighted in 1889,

410
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,958
and the last survivor of all,
a lonely female called Martha,

411
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,870
died in Cincinnati Zoo in 1914.

412
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,358
Birds are still being slaughtered
in huge numbers even today,

413
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,757
particularly when there are
economic reasons for doing so.

414
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,430
Dickcissels in Venezuela also swarm
in flocks millions strong.

415
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,234
The whole world's population
comes here in winter,

416
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,228
and they sometimes roost
in only three or four sites.

417
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,635
Should anything happen to those sites,

418
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,719
the dickcissels could go
the same way as the passenger pigeon,

419
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,718
and they are a very serious pest.

420
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,670
<i>Farmers know how to deal with insect pests.</i>

421
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,191
They spray them with poisons.

422
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,835
So the same technique
is sometimes used against dickcissels,

423
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,919
in spite of the fact
that it's against the law.

424
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,230
The birds, recorded here by amateur video,

425
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,715
take several days to die.

426
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,995
Yet humanity, so often in the past

427
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,556
the mindless and merciless
exterminator of birds,

428
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,832
can sometimes become their guardians.

429
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,795
Here, in a remote part of Tasmania,

430
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,235
a mining family has become
the saviour of the orange-bellied parrot.

431
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,750
For years, they've been putting out food
daily on a bird table,

432
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,748
and these parrots
became their best customers.

433
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,714
A century ago, there were certainly
many thousands of this bird here

434
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,717
and in south-east Australia.

435
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,037
But in the 1940s they began to decline.

436
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,074
The cause was probably competition
from introduced seed eaters

437
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,431
such as sparrows,
goldfinches and greenfinches.

438
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:28,475
Furthermore, 70% of their
mainland habitat was destroyed.

439
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,071
European cats living wild
in the bush also took their toll.

440
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,748
Now, not more than 200 survive,

441
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,997
and nearly all of them are here
during the nesting season.

442
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,036
The area is very isolated,

443
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:48,917
but bird-watching enthusiasts
are very enthusiastic.

444
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,275
They come not only from mainland Australia

445
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,631
but from all over the world
to see these rarities.

446
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,797
A special observatory has been built for them.

447
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,350
And special nest boxes within binocular range

448
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,313
have been put up for the parrots.

449
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,508
So, although the orange-bellied
parrot is still few in number

450
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,713
and therefore a very rare bird,
it's seen by thousands,

451
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:46,199
and, for the moment at least,
seems safe in its remote sanctuary.

452
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,555
This kestrel comes from Mauritius,

453
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,630
the scene of one of mankind's
earliest annihilations, of the dodo.

454
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,355
In 1974, only four known individuals survived.

455
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,031
Today, there are 5400 on the island.

456
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,313
They were saved by conservationists,
who took young from their nests

457
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,593
and reared them by hand,
so allowing the adults to lay again.

458
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,076
Today, each nest
is still being carefully monitored.

459
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,950
The bird is now
totally self-sufficient in the wild.

460
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,948
Just two free-flying pairs
are given extra food

461
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,798
as part of a long-term study.

462
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,553
The present population

463
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,435
is now just about as many
as the island can sustain.

464
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,357
The Mauritian pink pigeon
was thought to be totally extinct

465
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,757
until a small colony
was found in the mountains.

466
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,988
But that dwindled
to just nine known individuals.

467
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,718
They too were persuaded to breed in captivity.

468
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:36,110
The young are taken from nests
and given to barbary doves to rear,

469
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,709
so releasing the adults to breed again.

470
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,953
Now, pink pigeons are being released
in three different parts of Mauritius.

471
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,754
Feeding programmes have also been started

472
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,272
to help these new populations
establish themselves.

473
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,398
Today, the birds are breeding regularly,

474
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:39,357
and the population has risen
from 9 to over 300 in just 7 years.

475
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,790
The Mauritian echo parrakeet
was once the world's rarest parrot.

476
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,117
Now, using similar captive breeding techniques,

477
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,836
there are 20 in captivity
and 80 in the wild.

478
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,475
The island of Mauritius, once a black name

479
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,075
in the history of humanity's
relationship with birds,

480
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,717
has become one of the showplaces
of species conservation.

481
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,672
In West Africa, in Cameroon, villagers celebrate

482
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,075
the forest beside which they live,

483
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,350
and in particular one of its birds.

484
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,196
Bannerman's turaco.

485
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,470
Many of the creatures of the forest,

486
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,309
such as the elephant
that also figure in this celebration,

487
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,909
have long since disappeared.

488
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,831
The turaco, however, still survives,
though in the whole of this forest

489
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,554
there are only about 4,000 pairs,

490
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,830
and it lives nowhere else.

491
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,835
For decades the forest has been felled

492
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,430
to make way for fields in which
the people can grow their food.

493
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,918
It's now only half the size
it was 30 years ago.

494
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,509
Yet the people also know
that they depend on the forest

495
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,633
for water and firewood,
for medicine and for meat.

496
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,037
So now, a balance has been struck.

497
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,311
The traditional beliefs of the people

498
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,638
have been harnessed
to come to the forest's defence.

499
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,833
The masked figure of Mabu,
their spirit guardian,

500
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,749
accompanied by the village elders,
regularly patrols the margins of the forest.

501
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:07,191
Stakes are planted to mark the point
beyond which no tree may be felled.

502
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,075
The turaco has become
a symbol of the villagers' regard

503
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,111
for their environment.

504
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,358
And Mabu is now in league

505
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,199
with international bird conservation bodies

506
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,554
who are also concerned
about the survival of Bannerman's turaco.

507
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,191
In North America,
there are other masquerades,

508
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,359
to protect a bird
that is even rarer than the turaco.

509
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,233
A whooping crane chick learns to feed,

510
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,513
encouraged by the gestures and calls
of its human foster parents.

511
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:54,593
In 1945, only 16 whooping cranes existed.

512
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,109
Today, there are 300,

513
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:02,673
thanks to captive breeding
and the patient rearing of chicks by hand.

514
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,117
(SPEAKING QUIETLY)
And this is surely

515
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:11,519
one of the most extraordinary
hand-rearing devices yet invented:

516
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,712
a whooping crane adult hand glove puppet

517
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:19,357
with a trigger inside
so that I can operate the beak.

518
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:25,795
I'm speaking quietly because behind
each of these doors is a whooping crane chick,

519
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,479
and it's very important

520
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,672
that they don't get used
to the sound of human voices

521
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,791
at this early stage in their lives.

522
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,357
It's even more important, of course,
that they don't see human beings,

523
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,120
which is why they are fed
with this glove puppet.

524
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:53,039
Here at the International Crane
Foundation in Wisconsin,

525
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:57,518
they believe that, were the chicks
to be fed by humans directly and visibly,

526
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,269
they would risk becoming humanised,
so that when they became adult

527
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,836
they wouldn't be able
to breed with their own kind.

528
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,390
As they grow, the whoopers
lose all their brown plumage

529
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,795
and replace it with white feathers.

530
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:29,318
They must now learn
how to use them in flight.

531
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,988
And once again, they have to be shown
the sort of thing they must do.

532
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:01,594
Away to the west, in Idaho, a farmer
with a passion for cranes, Kent Clegg,

533
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:05,236
has also been rearing
a small group of whooper chicks.

534
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,753
He has a mechanised way
of persuading his little flock to fly.

535
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,195
He has reared them in a quite different way,

536
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,913
initially in small groups,

537
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,157
which he believes
will avoid humanising problems.

538
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,828
He then taught them to follow him.

539
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:25,919
Now he has put them together
with the young of a commoner, smaller species,

540
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,838
sandhill cranes.

541
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,713
They are the all-brown ones.

542
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:40,837
So the little mixed flock
has become confident in the air.

543
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:00,716
There's one further problem:
whooping cranes are migratory.

544
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,310
In the past, some used
to overwinter in the United States,

545
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,957
but many in the autumn
would fly south to New Mexico.

546
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:13,199
If these birds were to remain free,
they might try to do the same thing.

547
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,279
But how would they know which way to go
without their parents to guide them?

548
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,836
And how would they find somewhere
safe to feed when they got there?

549
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,156
Well, that problem is being tackled too.

550
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:41,636
Kent Clegg is planning to lead them
there himself, in his microlite.

551
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,592
Birds were flying from continent
to continent long before we were.

552
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,952
They reached the coldest place
on earth, Antarctica, long before we did.

553
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,152
They can survive in the hottest of deserts.

554
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,036
Some can remain on the wing for years
at a time. They can girdle the globe.

555
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:47,917
Now, we have taken over the earth
and the sea and the sky,

556
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,715
but with skill and care and knowledge

557
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,629
we can ensure that there is still
a place on earth for birds

558
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,400
in all their beauty and variety...

559
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,115
..if we want to, and surely we should.
