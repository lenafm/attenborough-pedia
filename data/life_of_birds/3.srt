
2
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,315
If you travel by air, it's very important
to keep your weight down to a minimum.

3
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,279
You can't afford to carry a lot of fuel around,

4
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,315
and what you do carry should be energy-packed
and not too bulky.

5
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,071
0ak trees put just such a substance
into their acorns.

6
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,037
It's there to fuel the growth of their seedlings,
and they protect it with a hard shell,

7
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,118
but jays know how to deal with that.

8
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,316
A beak is itself a concession to weight-saving.

9
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,709
It's much lighter than the jaws and teeth that
reptiles and mammals use to process their food,

10
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,799
yet it's also very efficient and versatile.

11
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,552
A jay using its beak like a pick

12
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,470
can cut through an acorn's armour
without any difficulty.

13
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,198
Beaks are closely matched to diet.

14
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,110
A goldfinch uses its beak like a pair of tweezers.

15
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,759
It's just the right length for extracting the seeds
from between a teasel's spines.

16
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,437
A blue tit, on the other hand, has a stubbier beak.

17
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,871
That gives it the strength to crack small seeds,

18
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,232
but it also prevents its owner from
getting them from a teasel

19
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,716
A greenfinch's beak is even stouter and stronger,

20
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,831
but it's far from clumsy.

21
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,508
Watch how, with the help from its tongue,

22
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,590
the bird delicately removes the outer shell
of these rosehip seeds.

23
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,238
The strongest beak in the finch family
belongs to the hawfinch.

24
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,352
That can even deal with the cherry-stone.

25
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,075
But the bird doesn't simply rely on brute force.

26
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,038
First, it manoeuvres the cherry-stone into
the right position for easy cracking.

27
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,838
It gets rid of the broken shell....

28
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:06,270
..and now it starts the fiddly operation of
removing the husk that covers the kernel

29
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,672
Pine trees, these are in California,

30
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,634
protect their seeds by enclosing them in cones.

31
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,472
When they're still green, the seeds developing
within are beyond the reach of most birds.

32
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:43,318
But the cross-bill has special equipment.

33
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:49,038
It's the only finch that can twist its upper
and lower bill in opposite directions.

34
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:11,239
Now, right at the bottom, it can feel
the soft young seed with its tongue.

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,275
Got it!

36
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,709
After a meal of pine seeds,

37
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,995
these American cross-bills regularly fly off to
a bank of exposed clay.

38
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,272
They're in need of digestive tablets.

39
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,914
Green pine cones are resinous,
and resin may cause stomach upsets,

40
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,797
but clay in the stomach will absorb the resin
and so prevent any trouble.

41
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,390
A crossed bill, however,
is not the best implement for digging.

42
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,513
You have to twist your head to one side
to get the point into the ground.

43
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,315
But the birds seem to manage to get
a sufficiently effective dose

44
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,911
to allow them to take daily meals
from the pine trees.

45
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,798
Seeds in the temperate parts of the world,
however,

46
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,118
whether they are in pine cones,
cherry-stones or acorns,

47
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,997
all have a major disadvantage as a food for birds
- they're very seasonal

48
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,194
In spring and in summer there's none,
and then in the autumn there's a glut.

49
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,032
A single oak tree like this can produce
90,000 acorns in a season.

50
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,314
But there are lots of things apart from birds
that eat acorns.

51
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,634
Squirrels do, for a start,

52
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,675
so if a jay is to collect acorns in the autumn,
it will have to do so quickly,

53
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,031
before others grab them all.

54
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,999
It is carrying one in its beak,
because its crop is full,

55
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,760
as you can see from that bulge on its throat.

56
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,589
There can be as many as nine acorns in there.

57
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:22,309
But what is a jay going to do with such quantities?
It can't eat them all.

58
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,149
They store them - by burial

59
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,599
0ne jay, in a month,
may bury as many as 3,000 acorns.

60
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,712
What is more, when winter comes
and it's in need of food,

61
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,118
it will remember exactly where most of them are.

62
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,235
In North America, oaks still form huge forests

63
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,116
and they produce acorns on an astronomical scale.

64
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,391
Among those that harvest them are woodpeckers.

65
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,350
A woodpecker's beak is a drill,
and a very efficient one,

66
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,553
so it's not surprising
that it stores acorns by drilling.

67
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,035
There are as many as 60,000 acorns
stored in the holes drilled in this one tree.

68
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,429
All the members of this woodpecker family,
eight birds in all, use this one tree.

69
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,836
To start with, the birds deposit
newly gathered acorns in a hole

70
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,679
to allow them to dry off.

71
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,030
Then, when they have shrunk as much
as they are going to do immediately,

72
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,869
they're given individual storage.

73
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,719
This larder provides food for the family
throughout the year,

74
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:39,029
but the birds have to be very vigilant
and ready at all times to repel raiders.

75
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,198
There's also a lot of maintenance work to be done.

76
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:55,191
As the acorns continue to dry and shrink,
they become loose in their sockets.

77
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:02,230
That would never do. They would be easy for
someone to steal They might even drop out.

78
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,429
0n the other hand, if they are hammered into
a hole that is too tight,

79
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,916
the shell could crack and then the acorn would rot.

80
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,759
So maintenance is a never-ending,
year-round labour,

81
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,191
and it takes a lot of care and judgement.

82
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,475
The result is a great acorn treasury that will last
the whole family well into the next harvest.

83
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,635
These neat holes are made, not for storage,
but for theft.

84
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,914
They're cut by another kind of woodpecker -
a sap-sucker.

85
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,279
They're just deep enough to tap the vessels
along which the tree transports its sap,

86
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,553
and sap is largely what the sap-sucker lives on.

87
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,998
The bird cuts its sap-wells
with an accuracy and symmetry

88
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,829
that would do credit to the finest cabinet-maker.

89
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,111
Sap normally hardens quickly and seals a wound.

90
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,236
This doesn't. It could be that the sap-sucker
produces an anti-coagulant in its spittle,

91
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,752
but if it does,
no one yet has managed to identify it.

92
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:57,115
Even so, each little well eventually runs dry
and the bird has to cut another.

93
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,430
These wells have been made in the trunk of a
pine tree which produces sap throughout the year.

94
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,230
0ther trees, such as these aspens, only produce
sap in quantity in spring and summer.

95
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,117
When the sap-sucker moves on to these,
it cuts differently shaped wells.

96
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,398
With this spring increase in the sap supply,
new birds appear in the woods.

97
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,637
A yellow-rumped warbler.

98
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,670
They're quick to drink from the wells
cut by the sap-suckers.

99
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,031
Food is short so early in the year.

100
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,673
The birches are now in leaf,

101
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,512
and the sap-sucker moves on to them,
and makes wells of yet a different shape.

102
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,432
A northern oriole - another hungry migrant

103
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,349
only too willing to benefit from
the labours of others.

104
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,233
And a hummingbird.

105
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,034
It used to be thought that hummers
timed their arrival

106
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,314
to coincide with the opening of the spring flowers
from which to drink nectar.

107
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,071
But they arrive well ahead of that.
Their appointment is with the rising of the sap

108
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,953
and the work of the sap-sucker.

109
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,518
Sap is an excellent food - energy rich
and easily flicked up with the tongue.

110
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,113
But it can only be collected from many of
these northern trees during part of the year.

111
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,677
So when winter approaches,
warblers and hummingbirds fly south again

112
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,758
to where it's summer all year long.

113
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,278
Here in Mexico, the sap is taken,
not only by birds, but by insects.

114
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,396
The trunks of many of the trees
seem to be sprouting long hairs.

115
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,273
At the end of each, there's a tiny drop of liquid.

116
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,555
The hair is a tube projecting from the rear of
an insect lying beneath the bark drinking sap.

117
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:38,710
But the insect gets more sugar than it needs,
so it excretes the excess.

118
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:46,189
And that is what the hummingbirds,
with exquisite accuracy, manage to collect.

119
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,033
Many different warblers take it too.

120
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,035
The liquid, rather flatteringly called ''honey-dew'',

121
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,756
is so much sought after that some birds
take up residence in a particular tree

122
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,270
and will drive away any others
that try to feed there.

123
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,995
Their meals, however,
come in such small instalments

124
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,829
that feeding has to be almost continuous.

125
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,439
It takes about an hour for a drop to accumulate
at the end of a tube,

126
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,790
so to get enough to sustain themselves,

127
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,314
the hummingbirds have to travel from one to
another on a regular round throughout the day.

128
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,235
Plants produce other edible things
as well as seeds and fruit and sap.

129
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,434
They sprout leaves, but in truth leaves
are not very good food.

130
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,313
They're very bulky and need a lot of digesting.

131
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,237
So animals that live on leaves,
like these cows, for example,

132
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,468
tend to be rather hefty creatures with massive
batteries of grinding teeth

133
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,672
and special capacious stomachs.

134
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:45,433
Cows, having grazed, lie down and bring up
each mouthful for a second grinding chew.

135
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,030
No bird does that - you can't chew with a beak.

136
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,913
Geese have to use a different technique.

137
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,398
They're big birds, as they have to be
to accommodate such bulky meals.

138
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,672
But instead of digesting the grass intensively,

139
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,910
they eat a very great deal of it and get rid of what
they can't digest almost immediately.

140
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,795
The appetite of geese is apparently never-ending,

141
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,629
and a flock of them, like these barnacles,
will work its way across a meadow

142
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,515
nibbling non-stop with almost feverish speed.

143
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,757
And pooping all the way.

144
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,554
It makes a terrible mess, but it does mean that
after feeding for several hours...

145
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,675
..the geese are not weighed down
by great quantities of undigested grass...

146
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,599
..and can get into the air without much difficulty.

147
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,436
In South Africa there's a rather
smaller leaf-eater - the mousebird.

148
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,395
They do make some attempt to digest their meals
a little more thoroughly.

149
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,349
They start feeding early in the morning.

150
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,839
Then, with as much nibbled leaves on board
as they can manage,

151
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,989
they sit for hours on end with their distended
stomachs turned towards the sun,

152
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,637
so that its warmth helps with their digestion.

153
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,072
You can't beat a siesta after a heavy meal

154
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,430
In all the bird kingdom, there's only one species
that is really specialised for leaf-eating.

155
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,270
This is it - the hoatzin of South America.

156
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,553
Like a cow it has two compartments
to its stomach,

157
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:16,118
the second of which is full of bacteria
that help ferment its meals.

158
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:26,755
In consequence it's a bulky bird
and positively clumsy in the air.

159
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,953
More a lumbering cargo plane than a super jet.

160
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,550
Birds, by stripping leaves,
eating seeds and drinking sap

161
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,673
are exploiting plants - stealing from them.

162
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:49,477
But many plants exploit birds
by using them as couriers.

163
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,636
The arrangement is such an ancient one

164
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,437
that both employers and employees have evolved
special ways of transacting their business.

165
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,599
The plants attract their couriers with flowers.

166
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,439
They pay them with nectar,

167
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,668
which is easy and cheap to produce, because it's
no more than water and sugar

168
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,269
and that's what I've got in here.

169
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,998
And these Australian rainbow lorikeets love it.

170
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,990
Here in Australia there are some plants that are
in flower throughout the year,

171
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,799
so it's possible for birds to specialise as
nectar feeders, as these lorikeets do.

172
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,913
Their tongues, instead of being hard and leathery,

173
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,477
have a feathery brushy tip
so they can lap up the nectar.

174
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:46,232
And the plants, when they have a need for
a messenger, advertise the fact

175
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,389
by producing flowers with
particularly bright petals.

176
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,913
Having collected all the nectar immediately
available on one tree,

177
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,510
the lorikeets move off in a flock
to feed at another,

178
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,439
carrying the pollen they collected with them.

179
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,518
But they take nectar
from many different kinds of flowers,

180
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,952
and if, as here, the plant they next visit
happens to be a different one

181
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,789
the pollen they're carrying will be wasted.

182
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:22,313
The plants way of reducing that risk
is to recruit an exclusive service

183
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,877
with couriers who, during their flowering season,
will visit them alone.

184
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:35,116
Here in South Africa, this species of heather
encloses its nectar in a ''floral safe''

185
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,233
which only a particularly shaped beak can unlock.

186
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,319
This orange-breasted sunbird
has a beak of that shape,

187
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,675
but even so, it has to probe really deeply
to reach the heather's nectar.

188
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,238
And every time it does,
it triggers a little explosion of pollen.

189
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,799
When the bird drinks at another heather plant,

190
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,075
some of that pollen will be brushed off
and the heather will have achieved its end.

191
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,750
But bird and flower can fit one another
more closely than that.

192
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,954
0n Mount Kenya, there's a sunbird with an even
more strongly curved bill

193
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,152
The golden-winged sunbird.

194
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,757
And this is its employer - the lion's claw flower.

195
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,036
The feathers on the sunbird's head look golden,
like those on its wings.

196
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,155
But not so - they're black.
The gold colour is entirely due to pollen

197
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,229
which is stamped on it when the bird
thrusts deeply into the flower.

198
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,316
The devices used by plants to restrict
their payments to their employees

199
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,718
may, if taken to extremes,
defeat the object of the exercise.

200
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,469
This South American plant
has gone, literally, to great lengths

201
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,150
to shield its nectar from all but
its established partner,

202
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,750
and that has encouraged burglary.

203
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,748
This is the black flower-piercer.

204
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,037
It knows exactly where the nectar is stored,

205
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,949
and it knows a quick way of getting it, too.

206
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,876
Its tongue is flicking into the nectary
at the top of the flower's trumpet

207
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,995
so that nectar is channelled down its lower bill
into its throat.

208
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:43,472
The datura has even longer flower trumpets,
but they are robbed just as easily.

209
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,993
Here in South America, hummingbirds are
the main collectors of nectar,

210
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,555
and they will collect it any way they can.

211
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:01,518
Using a break-in by a flower-piercer is as good
a way as any other, as far as they're concerned.

212
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,669
The trumpet of the datura flower is so long

213
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,159
that you might think that nothing
could drink from it - legally, as it were.

214
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,352
And only one bird can -
the sword-billed hummer,

215
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,872
which has the longest beak in relation to its body
of any bird in the world.

216
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,835
A plant only flowers for a short period each year,

217
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,556
so a nectar drinker has to have
a succession of suppliers.

218
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,275
A sword-bill also drinks from passion-flowers.

219
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,395
The South American climate is so equable
and the number of plant species so huge

220
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,115
that there are always some flowers to be found.

221
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,919
Accordingly, hummingbirds have evolved
highly specialised equipment for nectar feeding.

222
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,636
They have developed a unique way of flying
that allows them to hang stationary in the air

223
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,308
while they drink from a dangling blossom.

224
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:23,000
Their tongues have become threads that flick
in and out a dozen times a second,

225
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,910
but they're virtually useless for collecting
any other kind of food.

226
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,036
Where most plants tend to bloom
at the same time of the year,

227
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,268
neither the suppliers nor the drinkers of nectar
can be so specialised.

228
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,472
So the coral tree, blooming in Thailand,

229
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:51,789
has no alternative but to be generous
and offer its nectar in a free and open way.

230
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,111
This delectable seasonal treat attracts
all kinds of birds from far and wide.

231
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:08,913
Such a large and varied clientele is pretty well
bound to do the job required of them.

232
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,634
After they are pollinated, plants produce seeds

233
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,549
and then many engage other birds
to distribute them.

234
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,558
That, by and large, is heavier work,

235
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:00,312
and the payments they offer for that are made
with a different currency - fruit.

236
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:07,039
Hornbills are on their way to do a job for a fig tree
in the Indonesian rain forest.

237
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:37,116
In northern Europe and America,
waxwings gorge themselves on autumn berries.

238
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:43,156
A plant wraps its seeds in the minimum flesh
needed to persuade the bird to swallow them.

239
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,911
These berries have so little that it's quickly
stripped off in the waxwing's stomach,

240
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,557
and then the waxwing can get rid of
the indigestible seed.

241
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,032
The story is the same all over the world.

242
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,471
In New Zealand, kokakos are great berry eaters

243
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,798
and distribute the seeds of many of the plants
of their native forest.

244
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,037
In South America, tiny wild avocados

245
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,109
are the special favourite of one of
the most dazzling of birds - the quetzal

246
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,274
The avocados may be small, but they're still
too big for the quetzal to swallow.

247
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,234
So the stones are ejected, not from the back end,
but from the front.

248
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,550
The bird has had a good meal,

249
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,072
and the avocado has had some of its seeds
carried to a new site.

250
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:50,677
There are other things for birds to eat in a forest
apart from the products of plants.

251
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,431
They may be difficult to find;
they may be even more difficult to catch,

252
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,315
but they're well worth having
because they're full of nutrition.

253
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,990
Things, for example, like this.

254
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,671
The morpho - a big and powerful butterfly.

255
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,755
A jacamar - a cousin of the kingfisher's.

256
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,038
A butterfly's wings aren't very digestible

257
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:36,030
and have to be stripped off before the bird
can swallow the fat, nutritious body.

258
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,391
Winged termites erupting from their holes in the
ground and flying away to establish new colonies.

259
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,353
A whole host of birds relish these.

260
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,757
Ants are trickier meals. They, after all, can sting.

261
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,436
It takes a specialist to deal with them.

262
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,512
This is the rufous woodpecker of Southern India.

263
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,397
Its beak is just as efficient at demolishing
an ant's nest as it is at drilling into wood,

264
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,831
and the bird seems totally indifferent
to the ants' sting.

265
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,510
The feathers of its tail, like those
of all woodpeckers, are particularly stiff

266
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,109
so that they can serve as a prop.

267
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,393
The most nutritious morsels
are the soft, fat, stingless grubs

268
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,149
that can be found in the very centre of the nest.

269
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,909
Insects are almost everywhere on every tree;

270
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,591
on twigs, in buds, crawling
around in crevices of the bark,

271
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:05,909
and many birds find quite enough to sustain
themselves just by looking carefully.

272
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,155
But some work harder - and get greater rewards.

273
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,989
The nuthatch, in European woods, is indefatigable.

274
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,715
It will eat many things,
including seeds during the autumn and winter,

275
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,230
which it can crack with its workman-like beak,

276
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,637
but in summer, insects are a major part of its diet

277
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,709
and its beak serves equally well
for picking them out of the bark.

278
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,755
The greater spotted woodpecker
is a little more specialised.

279
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,555
It particularly likes
the grubs of wood-boring beetles,

280
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,799
and the first thing to do to find them
is to chisel away the bark.

281
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:34,037
Its tongue extends for an inch and a half beyond
its beak and has a harpoon at its tip.

282
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,514
When that hits a grub fair and square, it sticks.

283
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,552
Tree-boring insects are never safe
when woodpeckers are around.

284
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,189
But woodpeckers never got to the Galapagos,
far away from anywhere in the Pacific.

285
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:12,032
Insects did though, and their grubs bore into trees
here, just as they do everywhere else.

286
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,839
But no Galapagos birds have the physical
adaptations with which to reach them.

287
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,989
Galapagos finches, however,
are both intelligent and ingenious.

288
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,115
Their beaks are perfectly adequate
for stripping away bark.

289
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,957
There's a grub under there somewhere -
it can hear it.

290
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:50,280
But how, without the long tongue of a woodpecker,
can it get it out?

291
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,076
It needs a tool - a spine from a cactus.

292
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,915
A success - but only a partial one.

293
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,430
It has only extracted little bits of the grub.

294
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:37,596
Nearby, a bird from another clan of finches
uses a slightly different technique.

295
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:48,433
It selects a rather stouter tool that can be used,
not so much for stabbing as for levering.

296
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,912
That has shifted the grub a little nearer the hole.

297
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,477
It's not quite within reach,
but it's still got that lever handy.

298
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,469
Give it another go.

299
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,273
And that's got the rest of it.

300
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,038
Another remote and isolated island, on the other
side of the Pacific - New Caledonia.

301
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:46,792
It gets a lot of rain and so it has a much bigger
and richer forest than the Galapagos.

302
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,838
But it's so far from any of the major continents
that woodpeckers have not got here either.

303
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,438
This fallen tree-trunk is studded with holes;

304
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,757
the work of wood-boring beetles.

305
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,912
Their size suggests
that they're made by much bigger insects

306
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,078
than their equivalent on the Galapagos.

307
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:25,957
The New Caledonian crow - and crows are among
the most intelligent of birds.

308
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:33,472
0nce again, the sound of a grub gnawing away
in its burrow betrays its presence.

309
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,872
And once again, since this grub-hunter hasn't got
the long tongue of a woodpecker,

310
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,116
a tool is needed.

311
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:05,919
To contact this grub,
the stick will have to be thrust in really deeply.

312
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,712
A spectacular catch!

313
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:50,718
Some of these crows become so attached to one
particular tool that they carry it about with them.

314
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,351
This log is clearly a good source of grubs

315
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,633
and a whole group of crows
have come here to feed.

316
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,079
Their technique is neither to stab nor to harpoon,

317
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,239
but something more subtle - to irritate.

318
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,834
This grub has got big jaws and, if attacked,
it can give a powerful bite.

319
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,236
And that's what the crows rely on.

320
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:28,152
A younger bird joins an experienced adult
to see how things are done.

321
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,956
Now the pupil has a chance.

322
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,037
It hasn't got all the details exactly right.

323
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,789
It will be about a year before it masters the skill.

324
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,835
There are insect grubs everywhere, of course.

325
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,875
The only problem for insect-eating birds
is getting at them.

326
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,993
But sometimes other creatures are of help.

327
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,756
You might think that this is a recent partnership,

328
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:57,274
but I'll bet when our prehistoric ancestors first
dug for tubers and planted seeds in Europe

329
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,871
one of these little robins appeared
within a couple of days.

330
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,510
0ther animals must have done the same job
for them before human beings did.

331
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:17,073
0nce, not so long ago,
wild pig were common all over Europe,

332
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,875
and they're great diggers and rootlers.

333
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:29,036
So maybe the robin's boldness and friendliness
with other kinds of animals

334
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:34,951
started in prehistory,
even before human beings arrived in Europe.

335
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:51,555
Such partnerships exist all over the world -
even in the most unlikely places.

336
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,470
This little bird lives on a small island in
the Indian 0cean, one of the Seychelles:

337
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:02,630
so small and so isolated that few mammals
got here before human beings.

338
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,519
It's not closely related to the European robin,
but it behaves just like one.

339
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,599
When Europeans first came to the Seychelles
and saw it,

340
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,349
they called it a robin because of its similar habits.

341
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:26,759
But what partner did it have
before human beings came along?

342
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,155
Could it be this?

343
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:49,313
0nce there was a large population of these giant
tortoises on several islands in the Seychelles.

344
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:59,598
They weigh several hundredweight and those
huge legs dig into the ground with every step.

345
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,358
There we are!

346
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,553
These little birds, now even rarer than
the tortoises themselves,

347
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,629
are still their regular companions
as they plod around the island.

348
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,749
A swamp in South America.

349
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,274
An abundance of water and a warm tropical sun
make it a paradise for insects of all kinds.

350
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,758
A kind of fly-catcher - a cattle tyrant,

351
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:36,638
and another obliging partner - a capybara,
a large semi-aquatic rodent.

352
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:42,676
As the capybara moves around it inevitably
disturbs insects of some kind or another,

353
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,352
and what better place for an insect-eater to
spot them than sitting on the back of one.

354
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,035
Would the view be any better from there?

355
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,510
Perhaps it would be.

356
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,038
A few of these partnerships
between birds and other kinds of animals

357
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,152
have become very intimate indeed.

358
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,956
The hide of a hippo may not seem
a particularly rich source of insects,

359
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,438
but there are little ticks to be had
in the various cracks and crannies,

360
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,713
and ox-peckers go there to search for them.

361
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:44,111
They have extremely sharp claws, with two toes
pointing forwards and two backwards,

362
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:49,678
so that they can cling at any angle -
even on a slippery hippo.

363
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:03,550
Land animals with hair on their hide
are likely to be more productive ground.

364
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,275
0x-peckers pay particular attention to their ears.

365
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:12,873
That's the sort of place where you find ticks.
And if there is one, the ox-pecker will remove it.

366
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,072
And they also eat earwax.

367
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,153
Dandruff is another part of their diet.

368
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,755
Their beaks are flattened so that,
with their head held sideways,

369
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,077
they can comb through their hosts' hair.

370
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:49,750
0x-peckers spend all their life on,
or closely beside, their animal hosts.

371
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,349
They court and mate on their backs.

372
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:58,999
And when they fly off to make a nest, as they
must do, they pluck hair from their hosts' backs

373
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,751
with which to line it.
But do they do anything in return?

374
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:10,308
They remove irritating, even damaging, insects
that their hosts can't dislodge for themselves.

375
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,159
But the bird's main diet is blood.

376
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:17,069
Sometimes they get it by swallowing ticks
that are bloated with blood.

377
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,116
But they also take it directly, pecking at
an animal's wounds to keep them open.

378
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,472
When their hosts get irritated,
they go back to their toiletry duties,

379
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,719
before once again snatching a sip.

380
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:45,391
So, in spite of having such a specialised life,
living on the bodies of mammals,

381
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,194
ox-peckers manage to get quite a varied diet.

382
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:54,589
A maggot here, a tick there, a little sip of blood,
perhaps a little tasty earwax.

383
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:00,591
But there are some birds that literally live
on mammals - alive or dead.

384
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:07,638
They eat them; and those are the birds we'll be
looking at in the next programme in this series.
