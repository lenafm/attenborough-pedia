2
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,357
For this brown pelican,

3
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,552
the problems of bringing
new life into the world

4
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,513
have started even before
the eggs have hatched.

5
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,554
They've had to be kept cool or warm,
according to the time of day,

6
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,637
and they've had to be defended.

7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,513
But that is only the beginning of things.

8
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,795
0nce their chicks have disentangled
themselves from their shells,

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,310
the first job
of these brown pelicans here in Florida,

10
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,833
as it is with all bird parents,
is to find food urgently.

11
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,596
Few are in a greater hurry
than the Lapland bunting,

12
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,315
for summer in the Arctic is desperately short.

13
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,511
Food is rushed in.

14
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,676
Droppings are ferried out.

15
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,111
Both parents labour tirelessly,

16
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,030
and since it is light 24 hours a day
at this time of the year, they do so non-stop.

17
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,119
As a consequence,
the chicks grow at extraordinary speed,

18
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,950
and only 12 days after hatching
they will fledge.

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,835
Dippers are also dedicated
and industrious parents.

20
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,197
A nest behind a waterfall
is excellently concealed

21
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,277
but tricky to visit.

22
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,269
Nonetheless, these dippers, between them,

23
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,508
bring a batch of food
to their young every ten minutes.

24
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:03,031
Gouldian finches in Australia
make their nests in holes in trees.

25
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,954
The disadvantage of doing that
is that it may be so gloomy within

26
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,958
that it's difficult to see where the chicks are.

27
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,315
The solution? Vividly-coloured spots
on the side of the mouth.

28
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,394
And when vibrations
made by a parent as it enters

29
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,036
tell these still-blind chicks
that food is on the way,

30
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,071
they quickly provide extra guidance.

31
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,319
With gapes patterned as vividly as this,

32
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,789
the parents have no doubt
about where to post their food parcels.

33
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,633
These are zebra finches.

34
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,552
And these extraordinary objects
are young firetail finches.

35
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,596
What look like goggles are actually
markers to indicate the corners of the mouth.

36
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,237
These are the chicks
of Australian rosella parrots.

37
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,194
Their parents started incubating
as soon as their first egg was laid.

38
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,552
That, therefore, was the first to hatch
and its chick the first to be fed.

39
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,470
So to begin with, there is a difference
in size between the chicks.

40
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,148
But rosella parents are scrupulously fair,

41
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,151
and they make quite sure that even
the youngest gets its proper share of food.

42
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,198
Even so, after ten days,
the eldest is still the biggest.

43
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,232
But remarkably,

44
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,638
it sometimes shares its food
with the youngest and the smallest.

45
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,358
They are beginning to lose their down
and proper feathers start showing through.

46
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,949
An itchy business apparently.

47
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,830
Three weeks later,
in spite of five days' difference in age

48
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,077
between the oldest and the youngest,
they are all the same size.

49
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,839
Rosellas feed their chicks with
a regurgitated porridge of chewed-up seeds.

50
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,398
Great-crested grebes, on the other hand,

51
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,752
offer their newly-hatched young
much stranger meals.

52
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,277
Feathers.

53
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,754
This is not a mistake or an occasional quirk.

54
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,157
Swallowing feathers is essential
for the health of grebes.

55
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,070
They form a lining in the stomach which
protects it from the sharp bones of the fish,

56
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,114
which is the main part of a grebe's diet.

57
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,237
When the chicks grow up,
they will swallow their own feathers,

58
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,672
but now their parents
obligingly provide them.

59
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,636
And that's just as well
considering the size of the fish

60
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,630
that the youngsters are prepared
to tackle early on in their young lives.

61
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,031
These open-billed storks,
nesting in the sweltering heat of Thailand,

62
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,390
have also got young chicks.

63
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,319
0ne of their problems is keeping cool,

64
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,479
and one of the ways of solving it, of course,
is to take a nice cool shower.

65
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,275
But some showers are nicer than others.

66
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,355
The adults bring water
back to the nest in their crops,

67
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,553
and empty it over the featherless chicks.

68
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,910
But showers are not the only things
that the chicks need.

69
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,635
Sitting virtually naked
in the baking sun could be lethal

70
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,358
During the hottest part of the day
they are in desperate need of shade....

71
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,318
and the parents provide it.

72
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,959
The storks, like many birds,
are exemplary parents,

73
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,756
tending to the appetite and the comfort
of their offspring with care and devotion.

74
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,350
But not all birds behave in such a way.

75
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,191
It's an idyllic scene -

76
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,918
a pair of birds devotedly
caring for their chicks in the springtime.

77
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,069
But for the adult birds,
this is a very testing time, particularly if,

78
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,833
like these coots,

79
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:41,234
you may have as many as nine chicks
and the food supply is far from certain.

80
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,356
Things start well enough.

81
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,996
0ne of the adults uses particles of food

82
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,035
to tempt a newly-hatched chick
down from the nest and on to the water.

83
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,519
The little flotilla sets off
under the care of both parents.

84
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,752
But the food they prefer
comes in very small instalments -

85
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,713
tiny shrimps and water insects.

86
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,876
It takes a lot of collecting.

87
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,309
And there are other troubles and stresses.

88
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,637
Trespassers can't be allowed
on to the coots' feeding grounds.

89
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,197
They have to be seen off,
no matter how big they are.

90
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,752
Then, nearly always on the third day,
the parents begin to lose patience.

91
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,554
A chick begs for food yet again...

92
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,950
..and is punished.

93
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,276
Each chick in turn gets this harsh treatment.

94
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,155
Maybe the adults are testing them
to see which are the strongest.

95
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,194
After a time,
they concentrate their punishment on one,

96
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:09,509
and to such a degree
that it stops begging and so starves to death.

97
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,277
But unless there is a superabundance
of food, the persecution goes on.

98
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:28,229
In the end, the coots will only raise
two or three out of their brood of nine.

99
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,237
Life for young pelicans can be equally brutal

100
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,557
As they grow, so do their appetites.

101
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:53,235
No matter how hard the parents work,
they cannot bring enough food for all three.

102
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,758
The last to hatch was
always smaller than the other two.

103
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,953
It was always the last to be fed,
and now the two older ones turn on it.

104
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,554
Now it will not survive.

105
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,719
Its parents will not
bring any food to it on the ground.

106
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,516
And that's not the end of it.

107
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,508
No sooner has one been pushed out of the nest
than a second will follow,

108
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,075
until there is only one left.

109
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,193
And that's what happens
nearly always in a pelican's nest.

110
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,791
That being the case, it seems
rather inefficient, not to say heartless,

111
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,992
that the pelican
should always lay three eggs.

112
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,636
But the reason
is that it's partly an insurance policy.

113
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,798
In case something terrible happens
to one or two of the chicks,

114
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,116
there's always a third left to carry on;

115
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,471
and partly because,
very rarely, when the fishing is very good,

116
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,877
it is possible to raise more than one chick.

117
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,949
So bringing up the young
is a very demanding business indeed.

118
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,676
And in most birds it requires
the full-time labour of both male and female.

119
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,953
But one or two birds
manage to avoid it altogether.

120
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,553
And one of them is a regular visitor
to this reed bed in England.

121
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,751
A cuckoo,
and she is raiding a reed warbler's nest.

122
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,232
That's one of the reed warbler's eggs gone.

123
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,114
And while she holds a second in her beak,

124
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,233
shuddering with the effort,
she lays one of her own.

125
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,232
The match is near perfect.
The cukoo's is the one at the front.

126
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,592
The reed warblers don't notice
the difference and continue incubation.

127
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,633
The cukoo has timed her action with care.

128
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,356
She laid her egg immediately after
the female reed warbler laid the last of hers,

129
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,312
but it develops much faster

130
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,991
and will hatch three or four days
before the legitimate eggs do.

131
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,432
The young cuckoo, blind and naked,
now deals with the remaining warbler eggs.

132
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,392
Two weeks later,
the monstrous young cuckoo is so big

133
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,672
that it can no longer fit inside the tiny nest.

134
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,998
Its brilliantly-coloured gape,
together with its call,

135
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,998
that mimics the sound
of a brood of warbler chicks,

136
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,069
constitute a demand for food
that the warblers find irresistible.

137
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,998
The European cuckoo's habit is so famous

138
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,079
that we tend to think
it is the only bird to behave in this way.

139
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,035
But there are birds in half a dozen
other families that do so as well.

140
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,794
Here in Argentina,
brown-hooded gulls are nesting.

141
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,798
Gulls are so vigorous and enterprising

142
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,599
that they might seem the last birds
likely to be tricked, but on occasion they are.

143
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,317
A duckling.

144
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,990
Its true parents, cuckoo ducks, are far away
from the nest where they dumped their egg.

145
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,194
Their offspring will never see them,
just as they never saw their parents.

146
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,832
The duckling cannot know
that it is quite different from the baby gull

147
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,271
which has now hatched out alongside it.

148
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,514
Nonetheless, something tells it
that it must not stay with this other nestling.

149
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,512
0n its very first evening, it leaves.

150
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,114
Unlike the cuckoo, it makes no further
demands on the bird that incubated it.

151
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,599
Even though it is only a few hours old,
it is perfectly capable of fending for itself.

152
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,080
Young goldeneyes also have
a somewhat precipitate start to life.

153
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,799
The female goldeneye
regularly lays in a woodpecker's hole.

154
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,756
But when her young
have got over that handicap,

155
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,758
she solicitously leads them down to water,

156
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:40,195
for that's the only place where they, like most
ducklings, can gather food for themselves.

157
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,236
Here in British Columbia,
there is no shortage of lakes,

158
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,796
and their mother goes ahead
and calls to them to join her.

159
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,913
This lake, however,
has already been claimed -

160
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,793
by another female goldeneye with her brood.

161
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,070
And she is very possessive.

162
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,629
There's going to be trouble.

163
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,432
The newcomer has to leave.

164
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,038
But her ducklings can't fly away with her.

165
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,034
So they join the resident family.

166
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,958
That's no problem for mother.
They can fend for themselves.

167
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,312
And having an enlarged family
reduces the chances of her own ducklings

168
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,956
being taken by a hungry fish or a hawk.

169
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,674
In the end, she may accumulate
a flock of twenty or more.

170
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,070
A river in the high Andes.

171
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,151
Unlikely though it may seem,

172
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,354
some ducks manage to live on
these racing waters as well - torrent ducks.

173
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,114
These have made their nest
in the rocks thirty feet above the water,

174
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,632
high enough to be safe
if the river were suddenly to rise.

175
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,793
But that means that these ducklings
also have a very hazardous journey to make.

176
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,632
Even mother has a little trouble.

177
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,598
The racing water might seem to pose
even greater problems than the slippery rocks.

178
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,997
But the ducklings are so buoyant
that they float on the surface,

179
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,395
and are in no danger of drowning.

180
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,479
Nor are they swept away,
for, miraculously, they know instinctively

181
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,468
how to shelter in the eddies
in the lee of a boulder.

182
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,315
And once launched,
they, too, can feed for themselves.

183
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,478
Summer on the Arctic tundra.

184
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,035
Brent geese came up here a few weeks ago,

185
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,756
to feed on the newly-sprouting
vegetation and to nest.

186
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,076
Now their offspring have hatched.

187
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,273
They too will have to face
a dangerous journey before they can feed.

188
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,910
This pair built their nest
within a few yards of a snowy owl's nest.

189
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:16,195
That was good sense, for ground-nesting
birds here are likely to be attacked by foxes.

190
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,430
0wls are quite prepared to tackle foxes.

191
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,435
And so they seldom venture near.

192
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,991
While they were incubating,
the geese benefited greatly

193
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,589
by nesting beside
such a powerful neighbours,

194
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,749
but now their eggs are hatching
and that will change things.

195
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,796
0wls feed on lemmings.

196
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,118
And lemmings are about
the same size as goslings.

197
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:10,076
Somehow, these little creatures
will have to avoid becoming one more meal

198
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,794
for a hungry owl

199
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,595
But they must leave their nest
if they are not to starve.

200
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,952
Their parents are well aware of the danger.

201
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,872
Equally, the male owl can see
that there is a meal to be had.

202
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,872
Parental bravery wins the day.

203
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,394
Two birds to guard the young are good.

204
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,949
Three are even better.

205
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,359
Magpie geese live in northern Australia,

206
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:54,078
and the journey their goslings have
to make in order to feed is also dangerous.

207
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,319
Magpie males are very unusual in that
normally they will mate with two females,

208
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,351
who will both lay in the same nest.

209
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,710
So it is usually three adults,

210
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:07,118
and only occasionally two,
that escort their young.

211
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,999
In the skies above, a sea eagle.

212
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,269
It spots a trio with chicks...

213
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,480
..and they manage to see it off.

214
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,553
A pair are an easier target.

215
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:17,399
Angry and brave the two adults may be,
but it's too late.

216
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,117
Attacks can come not only from the sky,
but, more unexpectedly, from below.

217
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,551
Crocodiles.

218
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,396
Even the adults themselves
are now in real danger.

219
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,751
And the goslings are very vulnerable indeed.

220
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:15,000
The pair have made it, but only two
of their five young have survived.

221
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:22,749
The trio has succeded
in bringing down four or five chicks.

222
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,794
Here in the feeding swamps,
there is comparative safety.

223
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,677
All can join in keeping eagles away,
and the water is too shallow for crocodiles.

224
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,998
Nonetheless, overall,
the journey cost many young lives.

225
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,919
But the families that lost least were the trios.

226
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,680
So there really is safety in numbers.

227
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,518
And here in the Seychelles,
numbers are astronomical -

228
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,836
a million sooty terns.

229
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,798
Here, surely,
there must be safety from predators.

230
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,555
But egrets stand around
the fringes of the colony,

231
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,150
and they will swiftly seize a chick
if it's left unguarded.

232
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,157
A chick is such a good meal

233
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:43,276
that the egrets will even risk stabs
from the beak of a parent to get one.

234
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,191
Further into the colony, the chicks are
surrounded by a great crowd of adults,

235
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,277
and are very much safer.

236
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,356
Even a few yards from the edge,

237
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:09,156
the egrets face such determined
and effective opposition from all directions

238
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,999
that they stand little chance of success.

239
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,314
Chicks that have the luck
to hatch in the very centre

240
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,229
are five times more likely
to survive than those on the edge.

241
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,277
And there's another way for a bird
to protect its chicks.

242
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,595
Rear them in a place so remote

243
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,234
that few other creatures
can get there to threaten them -

244
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,637
a place like the Australian desert.

245
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,673
Here banded stilts nested
beside a temporary lake.

246
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,000
Soon after their eggs hatched, the females
left and started nesting again elsewhere.

247
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,909
Now the youngsters have gathered
in groups several hundred strong,

248
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,510
with only just a few males left behind
to keep an eye on them.

249
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,913
The job is not too difficult,
for the salty waters are full of tiny shrimps

250
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,556
that the young stilts
can collect for themselves.

251
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,069
For other birds, however,
finding food is so difficult

252
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,238
that even two parents
can't feed their chicks unaided.

253
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,591
Farther south in Australia,
in the eucalyptus woodland,

254
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,633
white-winged choughs have that problem.

255
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,958
Their young feed on beetle grubs,
and those are so difficult to excavate

256
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:55,631
that a pair will need at least two adult
helpers to keep one chick fully fed.

257
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,197
And the more helpers they have,
the more chicks they can raise.

258
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:08,672
This chick is almost fully grown
and so has a very big appetite.

259
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,155
All four birds labour away to keep it supplied.

260
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:39,112
Eventually, however, it will
change from being a liability into an asset,

261
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,549
a young bird that can help
in rearing a chick next year.

262
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,039
Another group of choughs
appears in the trees.

263
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,755
It has many more members.

264
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:10,879
The residents are worried, and show
their agitation by goggling their eyes.

265
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,675
This is a press gang.

266
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,996
They are kidnappers.

267
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,394
And this is what they are after.

268
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,117
0ne of the raiders
starts to display to the chick,

269
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,153
trying to entice it away
from its parental group.

270
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,434
And it follows.

271
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,797
A kidnapping has been achieved.

272
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,319
The raiders feed their new recruit,

273
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,796
and it joins the group's own youngster.

274
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,799
Now they have two juveniles.

275
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,991
Next year, the support team will be so big

276
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,398
that they may be able to raise
three or even four chicks.

277
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:32,994
So having difficulties in raising baby
can lead to sociability among adults.

278
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,512
But perhaps the most sociable of all birds,

279
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,156
birds that behave almost
like a troop of little monkeys,

280
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:50,114
live here in the deserts of the Middle East.

281
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,676
An Arabian babbler.

282
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,678
But you hardly ever see just one.

283
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:15,718
Arabian babblers do everything together
if they possibly can,

284
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,117
and that certainly includes taking a bath.

285
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,479
After a bath,
the whole group sunbathe together.

286
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,668
0nce dry, they preen each other.

287
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,391
In fact, Arabian babblers
do most things as a group.

288
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,074
They all share the labour
of collecting food for the group's chicks.

289
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:37,799
They also share the responsibilities
for defence, taking it in turn to act as sentry.

290
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,911
When another sentry comes on duty,

291
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,193
it brings a morsel of food
as part of the hand-over ritual

292
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,592
A viper!

293
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,595
The sentry sounds the alarm.

294
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,036
The whole group assembles.

295
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,518
By creating a commotion, they ensure
that everyone is aware of the danger.

296
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,748
They also discomfort the snake
and perhaps distract it from hunting.

297
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,391
It may also be that some of them,

298
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,558
by deliberately
taunting the snake at close quarters,

299
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,035
are demonstrating their strength and fitness

300
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,028
in a way that will give them
respect and seniority within the group.

301
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,836
0nce the danger is past,
life returns to normal

302
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,079
The sentry goes back to guard duties,

303
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,273
and the youngsters
start to play among themselves.

304
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,559
Many young birds
are abandoned by their parents

305
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,716
almost as soon as they are capable of flight,

306
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,038
so they have little chance to play
and gain the skills they will need as adults.

307
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,674
But the babblers form such a coherent group

308
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,032
that the juveniles
can spend time doing just that.

309
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,748
For the young anhingha in Florida,
learning through play is essential

310
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,838
If it doesn't become a skilled juggler quickly,

311
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,439
it will starve.

312
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,596
It must learn to do this.

313
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:14,154
0f course, it is important when playing
with a stick not to take the game too far.

314
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,154
Gannets also fish by diving,

315
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:24,480
and that is a skill that can't be practiced
by the young until they can fly.

316
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,118
The parents deal with this problem
by feeding their young so generously

317
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,915
that, by the time they've fledged
into their dark immature plumage,

318
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,076
they've accumulated reserves of fat

319
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,716
that will sustain them while they are
learning to catch fish for themselves.

320
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,514
So now they are heavier than their parents.

321
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,038
But that extra weight is a liability.

322
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,708
It makes it more difficult for the young to fly.

323
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,550
The seas beside
this South African colony are dangerous,

324
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,752
and not only because of the pounding surf.

325
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,833
Had there been cliffs from which
to launch themselves into the air,

326
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,759
as there are around many gannet colonies,

327
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,916
their first flight would be easier.

328
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,678
But there aren't.

329
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,793
No wonder
they appear nervous about taking off.

330
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,638
Fur seals are waiting.

331
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,910
But in spite of the seals,

332
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,908
many young gannets
do manage to get into the air.

333
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:23,833
Flight for young birds is the essential skill,
and the penalties of failure can be fatal,

334
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,430
so birds do all they can to prepare for it.

335
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,318
The young open-bill storks, now fully grown,

336
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,638
are strengthening their flight muscles
with regular exercises.

337
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:56,196
A young hummingbird cautiously
practices hovering while still in the nest,

338
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,279
even though that makes life
somewhat difficult for its sibling.

339
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,670
0n the tundra, the snowy owl chick,

340
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:19,477
still semi-clothed in down,
has got plenty of room for practice.

341
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,914
And the surviving brown pelican
at last leaves its platform nest.

342
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,357
It joins other youngsters
sitting at the edge of the sea.

343
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,515
Each has already survived
many perils in its young life.

344
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:27,272
As a chick, it fought battles
with its brothers and sisters and won.

345
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,996
For nine or ten weeks, it was
devotedly fed and protected by its parents,

346
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,191
but now it's on its own.

347
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,517
If it in its turn is to raise young,

348
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:42,032
it has many more battles ahead of it
out there on the sea

349
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,071
and in the air.

350
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,629
Life for all birds everywhere can be hard,

351
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,718
but some species
have become specially adapted

352
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,673
to the harshest environments on Earth.
