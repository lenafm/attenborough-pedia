
2
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,399
These sooty terns are amongst
the most aerial of birds.

3
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,674
Every one of them has spent the first
three or four years of its life flying non-stop.

4
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,154
Feeding on the wing,

5
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,399
swooping down picking up fragments
of food from the surface of the sea,

6
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,556
even sleeping on the wing.

7
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,470
But there is one thing that compels them
to come down to earth.

8
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,069
This.

9
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,316
Flying with an egg inside the body,
let alone a clutch of three or four,

10
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,398
makes huge demands
on the energy of a bird.

11
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,469
So every female bird in existence
gets rid of that huge load

12
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,150
just as soon as she can.
She lays it.

13
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,079
In places like this island in the Seychelles,

14
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,874
where there are no land predators
to steal eggs,

15
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,437
it's safe for the sooty terns
to put those eggs directly on the ground.

16
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,595
The birds sit as close to one another
as they can

17
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,712
without getting within the range
of their neighbours' beaks,

18
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,436
so they are equally spaced
with almost mathematical precision.

19
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,194
0ther kinds of terns have other ideas
about where to put their eggs.

20
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,076
The fairy tern, for some reason,
always puts them on a bare branch,

21
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,912
though whether that is safer
or more dangerous is debatable.

22
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,509
The females seem wildly optimistic.

23
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,190
A U-bend is one of their safer ideas.

24
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,359
The dimple left when a branch
breaks away is not bad either.

25
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,235
But it seems a bit reckless
to rely on a little dead twig like this,

26
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,150
particularly when the trade winds blow as
strongly as they do in the Seychelles.

27
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,315
The fact is that fairy terns' eggs
are easily dislodged if left unguarded.

28
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,072
Skinks know that...
..and so do the fodies, the local sparrows.

29
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,873
And that has solved the problem
of how to crack it.

30
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,351
Yolk is provided by a female bird to nourish
her chick as it develops inside the egg.

31
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,870
But it is equally good food
for lots of other animals,

32
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,116
so eggs are much sought after,

33
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,075
and birds may have to go to great lengths
to keep them safe.

34
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,710
Swifts living on the mainland
have to take greater precautions.

35
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,675
The nests of palm swifts are minimal,
but they put them in fairly inaccessible places,

36
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,156
such as an isolated palm tree.

37
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,029
They stick a few feathers on the underside
of one of its dangling dead leaves,

38
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,710
using their spittle as glue.

39
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,319
To make sure that the egg stays
in this flimsy hammock of feathers,

40
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,911
<i>they stick that to the leaf as well.</i>

41
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,910
Changing places to take over incubation
is a tricky operation

42
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,795
when your nest is stuck to a vertical surface.

43
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,596
The power of flight enables birds
to put their nests in places

44
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,792
that are beyond the reach
of land-bound creatures.

45
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,755
And there can be few more inaccessible
spots than the rocks behind a great waterfall,

46
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,394
like this one at Iguacu in South America,

47
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,036
where Argentina and Brazil meet.

48
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,039
Swifts, once again,
exploit their mastery of flight

49
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,198
to go where no other bird can go.

50
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,958
Great dusky swifts roost for the night

51
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,869
on the mist-drenched rocks
alongside the falls.

52
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,868
But this is not a safe enough place
for their precious eggs.

53
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,914
<i>Theywill be deposited actually
behind the curtain of water</i>

54
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,237
<i>and to do that
the birds must find the thinnest part of it.</i>

55
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,997
Behind the curtain,
they still have an awkward climb

56
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,715
before they reach a place
where it is possible to put an egg.

57
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,279
And this is it, a perpetually dripping ledge,

58
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,268
just wide enough
to accommodate a little muddy nest.

59
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,351
Many birds choose cliffs for their nest sites

60
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,994
even when they are not screened by water.

61
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,794
Seabirds around the world use them.

62
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,913
But these aren't normal seabirds.

63
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,478
They're parrots and they are nesting
on the coast of Argentina.

64
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,354
The powerful hooked beak that all parrots have
and use for cracking nuts and gouging fruit

65
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,189
is also an excellent excavating tool

66
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,710
These cliffs are composed
of a relatively soft sandstone.

67
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,358
No problem for a parrot.
Even so, digging a hole in them is hard work,

68
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,348
so each hole, when it is finished,
is a valuable property,

69
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,348
and there is a great deal of competition
and squabbling over any vacancy.

70
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,910
Sand-martins are not nearly
so well equipped for digging.

71
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,271
They use their claws
rather than their delicate beaks

72
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,598
and they can only tackle sandstone
if it is soft and friable.

73
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,555
But what they lack in equipment
they make up for with energy.

74
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,154
Woodpeckers, of course,
are expert carpenters

75
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,272
and regularly chisel their nestholds in trees.

76
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,632
But this one is digging into softer material,
an ants' nest.

77
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,393
The ants are furious,

78
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,115
but they quickly get used to their lodger
sitting in the middle of their mansion,

79
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,792
and then they act as her guardians, attacking
any intruder that tries to steal her eggs.

80
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,510
You might think that a hornbill would have
the most powerful excavation tool of all,

81
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,871
but in fact its huge beak
is a relatively delicate structure

82
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,435
and no use at all as a chisel

83
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,998
So hornbills have to find holes that are either
natural or have been dug by others.

84
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,268
A pair do their househunting together
and they are very choosy.

85
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,034
Perhaps this one will do.

86
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,273
With beaks over a foot long,

87
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,314
these Great Indian hornbills
have to have a pretty big hole.

88
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,753
But they like the entrance to be
as small as possible to deter intruders.

89
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,753
<i>Maybe this is just too small.</i>

90
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,511
But she can just make it.

91
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,311
That's good.
The search is over.

92
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,795
This is it.

93
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,433
The male regurgitates a little food for her.

94
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,273
Now she has decided that this is for her,

95
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,758
she won't leave again until her eggs are laid
and hatched and the chicks well-grown.

96
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,589
She will depend entirely on her mate for food.

97
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,472
She seals herself in,

98
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,911
narrowing the entrance
with a plaster made of chewed wood,

99
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,430
mashed food and her own droppings.

100
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:11,239
This will be her home, you could say
her prison, for the next four months.

101
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,676
The majority of birds, though,
don't nest in holes.

102
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,876
<i>They buildtheir nests. And builders,
of course, need building materials.</i>

103
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:04,151
Having no hands, but just a beak
and at best one foot, seems bad enough,

104
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,716
but these frigates on the Galapagos
have got an additional problem.

105
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,914
Their feet are so short and their wings
are so wide that they find it difficult to land,

106
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,399
so they much prefer
to collect their building material on the wing.

107
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,790
Boobies can settle and break off
the branches they need for their nests.

108
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,074
Frigates can't, but they can steal

109
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,555
So for boobies, getting building material
from its source to the building site

110
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,991
is the most difficult part
of the whole business.

111
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,394
Stolen goods, it's true,
but all the more precious for that.

112
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,639
Eggs must not only be kept secure.

113
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,230
0nce they start to develop,
they also have to be kept warm

114
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,159
and there is no better insulation
than feathers.

115
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,229
Ducks and geese line their nests with
feathers they pluck from their own breasts.

116
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,159
0ther birds are not so self-sacrificing

117
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,353
and prefer to use
those that they find blowing about.

118
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,598
Tree swallows compete with one another
in collecting them.

119
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,952
Miss... and a rival won't give you
a second chance.

120
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,393
Even when you have got it
you may not get away with it.

121
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,639
Tackling a bird without the feather
is all within the rules of this particular game.

122
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,955
The golden-headed cisticola,
a kind of Australian warbler,

123
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,280
collects fibres and spiders' webs,
not just for lining, but for stitching.

124
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,713
There is no more skilled a tailor
in the whole of the bird world.

125
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,834
<i>There's little problem
about concealing this nest</i>

126
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,669
for the leaves she stitches together
remain alive and green.

127
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,997
When she has finished, you will barely notice
that they are bent together

128
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,668
in a slightly unusual way.

129
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:23,119
The problem is greater when a nest sits
on the bare branches of a tree.

130
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,710
The sitella, an Australian
equivalent of the nuthatch,

131
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,471
constructs its nest from spiders' webs
and insect cocoons,

132
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,912
and then covers the outside
with rather coarser material

133
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,510
Two pairs are building here,
close to one another.

134
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,430
This one is in a tree covered in lichen.

135
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:53,035
And this, in one that has flaky bark.

136
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,756
The sitellas are not rigidly-minded birds
with inflexible habits.

137
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,158
They use lichen
to cover the nest in the lichen tree,

138
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,557
and bark on the one in the flaky bark tree.

139
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,273
As a result, each is as well camouflaged
as anyone could hope,

140
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,075
and though both nests
are plain for all to see,

141
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,556
they are not easily recognised
for what they are.

142
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,956
The apostle bird uses mud mixed with grass.

143
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,154
Nest building is a group activity.

144
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,353
A pair with their grown-up young
from previous seasons work together.

145
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,950
It used to be believed
that there was always a dozen in the team

146
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,152
which is why they are called apostle birds.

147
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,192
Everyone seems anxious to contribute,

148
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,790
and the team works so industriously
and so harmoniously

149
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,879
that their elegant cup
is usually completed in a mere three days.

150
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,479
A bird's beak, it seems,
can serve just as well as a plasterer's trowel,

151
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,035
as a tailor's needle.

152
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,355
Some birds build nests not just as cradles
for their eggs and chicks,

153
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,348
but as lodging houses for the whole year.

154
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,348
Here in Namibia in Southern Africa
lives the sociable weaver,

155
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,710
and very sociable it is, too.

156
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,836
As many as three or four hundred birds
will live in a single apartment block.

157
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,397
This haystack
may be more than a century old.

158
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,559
It is so heavy that part of it
has broken the branch that supported it

159
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,159
and fallen to the ground.

160
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,480
And it's been built and maintained
as a communal effort by all the inhabitants.

161
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,832
Weavers are closely related to sparrows.

162
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,112
Though some of their relations
do indeed weave,

163
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,595
the sociable weaver
builds in a rather simple way.

164
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:52,670
It just pushes straws, one by one,
into this gigantic bale.

165
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,396
A large communal apartment block

166
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,037
has a considerable advantage
over small isolated nests

167
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,958
when you live in a desert like this.

168
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,879
During the day it gets ferociously hot,

169
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:17,519
but that thick roof of thatch keeps
the apartments beneath nice and cool

170
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:27,473
As the sun sets, the weavers, having been
away feeding, come back to their homes.

171
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,555
At night, it can get very cold in the desert,
as much as 7 or 8 degrees below freezing.

172
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,957
And then the thatch is probably
at its most valuable,

173
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,391
because it acts as insulation
for the nest chambers,

174
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,115
so that they retain much of the heat
that they had during the day,

175
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,836
and the birds that roost inside
remain snug and warm.

176
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,350
Not all the chambers are for nesting.

177
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,838
Some are not nurseries, but bedrooms

178
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,636
in which several of the colony
snuggle together for warmth.

179
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,791
So at last some kind of receptacle,
simple or complex, is prepared for the egg,

180
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,276
and it is time for the female to produce one.

181
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,313
The male frigate welcomes his partner back.

182
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,398
The crucial moment has arrived.

183
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,038
Mated female birds
have been feeding intensively

184
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,674
and their ovaries are much enlarged.

185
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,316
Each egg,
emerging from one as a microscopic cell,

186
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,833
is planted on a growing globule of yolk
which will provide it with food.

187
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:31,876
It is fertilised by one of the sperm
that has been lying awaiting it in the duct.

188
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:38,235
Albumen is wrapped around it to provide it
with the water necessary for development.

189
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,557
It travels onwards for several hours.

190
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,880
Eventually, it reaches a section in the duct
where there are glands that produce lime.

191
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,915
Here it lingers for 24 hours
while the shell is added.

192
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:59,230
Pigment glands
squirt little spots of colour on it.

193
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,468
And so, an avocet produces her egg.

194
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,558
The blotches and speckles
on such an egg as this, laid on the ground,

195
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,435
serve primarily to camouflage it.

196
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,194
These are the eggs of a golden plover.
They too are laid directly on the ground

197
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,712
and are practically invisible;
as indeed the bird that laid them will be

198
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,434
once she settles down.

199
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,192
Plovers nearly always lay four eggs.

200
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,869
A few birds, however,
have adopted a rather more risky policy.

201
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,390
They lay just two, or even one.

202
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,354
If they do that,
they must lay it in a nest that is really secure,

203
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,792
hidden, for example, deep in a burrow
as the kiwi does.

204
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,840
Her egg is gigantic,
the biggest laid by any bird,

205
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,873
and a quarter of her total body weight.

206
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,198
It contains so much yolk
that the chick will be fully developed

207
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,676
when eventually it breaks out of its shell.

208
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,149
Expelling such an egg
is obviously a huge effort.

209
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:08,999
<i>The owner of this nest, a blue tit,
adopts a very different strategy.</i>

210
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,990
Her egg is tiny. It weighs no more than a gram.

211
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,952
But she lays lots of them;

212
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,436
one a day, day after day,
for a fortnight or so,

213
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,270
but the chicks after they hatch
will face so many hazards that many will die

214
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,235
and the survival rate in
the end will be not unlike the kiwi's.

215
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,229
Few eggs are totally safe from hungry raiders,

216
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,831
no matter how skilfully protected
and artfully concealed they are.

217
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,477
Those lying in the bottom of these dangling
nests of caciques in South America

218
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,989
are certainly difficult to reach.

219
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,078
But the red-breasted toucan
has a long beak.

220
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,831
This toucan's bill is just
not long enough for these particular nests.

221
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,991
But the toco toucan has an even longer one.

222
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,436
The caciques are extremely agitated.

223
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,950
And with good reason.

224
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,591
If the caciques are to defend themselves
against these powerful bandits,

225
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,918
they will have to build
even longer nests in the future.

226
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,436
In Australia, the prime egg thief
is the currawong.

227
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,152
An unguarded nest.

228
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,357
An obvious target.

229
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,394
Another clutch gone.
Few eggs are safe from currawongs

230
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,478
and the Australian birds,
like birds everywhere,

231
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:34,310
have developed many different strategies
to try and foil burglars.

232
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,478
This is the nest of a yellow-rumped thornbill,

233
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,877
but in fact this neat little cup is empty.

234
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,311
You might think therefore,
that it has been robbed of its eggs.

235
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,911
But in fact this part of the nest
has never had any eggs in it.

236
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,240
There's another entrance to the nest.
It's down here.

237
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,994
You might never notice it,
until you watch the parent return.

238
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,039
The cup at the top is a dummy,

239
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,472
and it seems that many currawongs
have not yet discovered the fact.

240
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,516
This wren in Costa Rica
has another way of protecting its eggs.

241
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,231
Its nest is pretty obvious...

242
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,639
..and equally obvious
is another one close by, a wasps' nest.

243
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,516
The wren nearly always builds within
a yard or so of these formidable insects.

244
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,918
It is a brave thief
that risks being attacked by these.

245
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,999
But coatimundis are brave,
sometimes to the point of recklessness.

246
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,997
0ut here
on the cold windswept plains of Patagonia

247
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,875
there are no trees
in which a bird could build a nest.

248
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,949
So plovers, like plovers everywhere,
lay their eggs on the ground

249
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,515
and trust their camouflage.

250
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:18,637
But if a stranger wanders too near it,
one of the adults immediately responds.

251
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:27,718
Ahead, I can just see a bird
crouching on her eggs. And away she goes.

252
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:32,311
And now she starts
a most bizarre pantomime.

253
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:47,518
This hardly looks like any kind of bird,
and whatever it is, it seems to be crippled.

254
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,155
If I was a fox or maybe a hawk,

255
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:08,038
I might quite well think that this extraordinary
performance represents an injured bird

256
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,754
or maybe a little rodent.

257
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:17,593
Either way it looks like an easy meal and I
might follow it and be led away from the nest.

258
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,959
And now she has taken me so far from her
eggs that she can abandon her play-acting.

259
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,312
There is nothing the matter with her.

260
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,712
Having deflected me,
she returns to her nest.

261
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,718
She has to go back
to prevent her eggs getting chilled

262
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,559
and the young within from dying of cold.

263
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,630
Keeping eggs warm, indeed, is a continuing
problem for most nesting birds.

264
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,271
The maleo has a very labour-saving way
of dealing with its heating problems.

265
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,314
It lives on an island in Indonesia.

266
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,030
In this one unshaded patch of the beach,
the sand is kept so hot by the sun

267
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,515
that the eggs will hatch by themselves,

268
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,110
and the whole of
the local maleo population know it.

269
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,959
The birds are accurate judges
of temperature. They have to be.

270
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,993
If they don't dig deep enough,
their eggs will bake,

271
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,795
and if they go too far,
they won't develop.

272
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,673
That's probably about right.

273
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,873
Now all that is needed is to fill in the hole.

274
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,470
And then they abandon it.

275
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,636
These eggs, up in Alaska,
must be tended much more assiduously.

276
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,150
They belong to a snowy owl

277
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,876
As she returns, you can see that the feathers
on her belly are rather long and floppy.

278
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:37,198
There is even a glimpse of pink naked skin.

279
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,078
Her body has to be particularly
well-insulated with dense plumage

280
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,556
to prevent it losing heat
in these near-freezing conditions,

281
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,788
yet somehow she has to transfer
some of that heat to these eggs.

282
00:35:53,800 --> 00:36:00,069
This naked brood patch on her belly
will enable her to do just that.

283
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:11,479
Her mate is away hunting for lemmings,
not only for himself, but for her.

284
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,751
She cannot leave her eggs
for more than a minute or two,

285
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,956
so her mate looks after her, and
he will have to do this for almost two months.

286
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,120
The chilly lakes of North America.

287
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,713
<i>Here some birds trick others into looking
after at least some of their eggs.</i>

288
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,037
This female canvasback duck
is sitting contentedly,

289
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,630
incubating and minding her own business.

290
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:08,590
0ut on the water, another female
canvasback is mating with a drake.

291
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,037
The mated female
has not yet built a nest of her own,

292
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,550
so she makes her way to the one who has.

293
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,477
The sitting female
clearly doesn't like this intrusion,

294
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,037
but equally,
she's not going to abandon her eggs.

295
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,149
The intruder pushes her to one side
and quickly lays.

296
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,114
Sometimes the sitting bird
doesn't seem to realise what has happened

297
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,356
and accepts the egg.

298
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,948
But not this time.

299
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,036
There's a different kind of duck here, too.

300
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:25,870
It is a little smaller and the male has
a redder head and neck, the redhead duck.

301
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,595
His female has also cast her eye
on the canvasback's nest.

302
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,917
Perhaps she can try the same trick.

303
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,071
A canvasback egg is pale green,
a redhead's white,

304
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,238
so the redhead female
tries to make hers less obvious

305
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,035
by placing it
in the middle of the canvasback's clutch.

306
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,352
The male redhead awaits.

307
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,236
And the deed is done.

308
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,479
The female canvasback
leaves her nest for a meal

309
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,956
and reveals that this last intrusion
was not the first.

310
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,550
There are three white redhead eggs
in her nest.

311
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:55,317
Meanwhile, the redheads sail away
to make a nest of their own.

312
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,994
Distributing eggs between several nests,
as both canvasbacks and redheads do,

313
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,589
is like taking out an insurance policy.

314
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,117
And there are plenty of hazards on the lakes
against which a duck needs to insure,

315
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,436
if she possibly can.

316
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,195
Night is a time for burglary.

317
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,479
A racoon.

318
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,790
This clutch is finished,

319
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,518
but there is still a chance that one or two of
this female's eggs laid elsewhere will survive.

320
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,953
There really is sense
in not putting all your eggs in one basket.

321
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,714
Some birds, however,
don't care for any of their eggs.

322
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:32,552
As parents, they are totally irresponsible and
the most famous, of course, are the cuckoos.

323
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,957
This is a nest of an Australian fantail

324
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,917
The two little eggs belong to the fantails,
but the very big one is a cuckoo's.

325
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,511
It is so different that you would think
that the fantail would immediately recognise

326
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,030
that something is wrong.
But watch.

327
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:59,073
The fantail female is around,
but it's the male who comes back first.

328
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:05,069
He seems quite unaware
that anything is wrong.

329
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,077
The female cuckoo
is also keeping an eye on things.

330
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,989
The fantail has accepted the egg,
and that will be disastrous,

331
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,876
because when the bigger cuckoo chick
hatches, it will push out the baby fantails.

332
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,472
Maybe cuckoos
have only just started to do this

333
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,309
and fantails haven't yet developed a defence.

334
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,314
In North America,
the cowbird is also playing this game.

335
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,354
It has put an egg
in the nest of a gnatcatcher.

336
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,349
It's slightly bigger, but very similarly marked.

337
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,639
Will the gnatcatchers notice the difference?

338
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,715
They have.
They are destroying their own nest.

339
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,354
There is no future
for their own chicks in this one.

340
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,510
But nesting material is too valuable to waste,

341
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,598
so they are going to start again.

342
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,837
They begin a new nest quite close by.

343
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,839
Day after day they labour,
destroying the old and building the new.

344
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,432
And there goes the alien egg.

345
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:03,153
The cowbird has lost this particular duel

346
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,913
Africa.
The duels are being fought out here, too.

347
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,237
This is a colony of lesser masked weavers

348
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,115
and sitting in the trees nearby are,
once again, cuckoos.

349
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,551
These are diederick cuckoos.

350
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,232
The cuckoos, if they can, will dump
their eggs in the weaver birds' nest

351
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,159
and leave them there
for the weaver birds to rear.

352
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,749
And the weavers
seem well aware of the danger.

353
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:42,319
They are taking precautions, adding long
entrance tunnels to their globular nests

354
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,910
as they must have been doing
for many centuries.

355
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:01,514
The cuckoo watches for a recently finished
nest in which a female has just started to lay.

356
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,996
There's one.

357
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:33,713
But the cuckoo
is having a lot of trouble getting in.

358
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,318
In the past, cuckoo eggs
have been frequently found

359
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,397
in the nests of these weavers.

360
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,910
<i>But none seem to be getting
into this colony.</i>

361
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:57,990
Maybe the weavers are beginning to make
those entrance tubes just a little bit narrower.

362
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,877
The battle seems to be swinging
the weavers' way.

363
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,795
Nearby, there's a colony
of a slightly different kind of weaver,

364
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,595
the marginally bigger masked weaver.

365
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,996
They don't put entrance tubes to their nests,

366
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,510
perhaps because they themselves
are nearer the size of a cuckoo,

367
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,349
so any entrance they can get into,
a cuckoo could also.

368
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,553
They have a different defence.

369
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,036
The colours of their eggs
are extraordinarily variable,

370
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,277
ranging from pure white
to blue and speckled.

371
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,790
But any one cuckoo
can only lay one kind of egg.

372
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,391
And it has no way of knowing what colour
the eggs are in any particular nest.

373
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,558
So the odds are against the eggs matching.

374
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,548
Now I happen to know
that this nest contains speckled eggs.

375
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,878
Let's see what happens
if I put a pale egg in it.

376
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,277
Back comes the owner.

377
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:29,915
No doubt about
who's winning here either, this time.

378
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,278
The battle between cuckoos
and other birds is a continuing one.

379
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,315
The cuckoos developing new stratagems
and perhaps finding new victims,

380
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,318
and the victims finding new defences.

381
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,433
Soon, in those nests behind me,
eggs will start hatching.

382
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:54,272
Most will produce young weaver birds,
but some equally certainly, will be cuckoos.

383
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,997
Whichever they are, the young chicks
will be faced with a whole set of problems

384
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,829
that they have to solve
if they are to grow into adults.
