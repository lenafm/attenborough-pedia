
3
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,631
This lava gull in the Galapagos,

4
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,751
like all the rest of those birds,

5
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,918
is sending a very clear message with its call.

6
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,148
It is saying, ''I'm ready to mate
and I have got a great place for a nest''.

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,630
Some birds send the same message
but use an additional medium:

8
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,630
not just sound but vision,
as these frigate birds are doing.

9
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,596
Their visual signal
is normally an inconspicuous patch

10
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,268
of shrivelled skin on the throat.

11
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,871
It takes about twenty minutes to blow one up.

12
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,715
The females, who don't have
a throat pouch, cruise by

13
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,434
assessing what is on offer.

14
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,230
The size of the balloon gives them
a good indication of a male's vigour,

15
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,955
and therefore his desirability
as father of their chicks.

16
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,677
A female takes a closer look.

17
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,351
Males who haven't yet got a nest
keep a close eye on developments.

18
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,433
The female leaves,

19
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,756
and one of the homeless males

20
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,190
decides to make a challenge.

21
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,628
The throat pouch is an obvious target.

22
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,469
Tear that and its owner
won't be able to attract anyone.

23
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,718
A new proprietor takes over the nest site
and pumps up his balloon.

24
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,673
Success is swift.

25
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,956
She's found what she was looking for.

26
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,114
A male hornbill's brilliantly-coloured beak
and wattle is also an indication of his fitness.

27
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
Having attracted a female's attention,

28
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,798
he accompanies her on flights through the forest,

29
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,355
and, at appropriate moments,

30
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,155
he cements their relationship
with a few judicious gifts.

31
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,913
A little fruit.

32
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,154
Males world-wide ingratiate themselves
with females in this way.

33
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,069
Wattled guans do
in the tropical forests of Amazonia,

34
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,751
and so do great tits
in the suburban gardens of Europe.

35
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,990
Seabirds, of course, like fish,

36
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:44,230
though it is still the prerogative of the female
to decline a gift the first time it is offered.

37
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,630
Grebes like fish, too.
These are on a lake in North America.

38
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,197
But for grebes in particular, exchanging
presents is only the beginning of courtship.

39
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,790
There's a lot of dancing to be done
before the partners are sure

40
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,991
they are meant for one another.

41
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,077
Their first routines involve
repeating one another's movements.

42
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,078
0nce they have got to know
each other really well, however,

43
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,912
they perform their pas-de-deux together
with immaculate timing.

44
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,630
Their wings don't
contribute much to their costumes.

45
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,638
Like those of all diving birds,
they are short and stubby.

46
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,400
But the dancers make up for that
with impressive footwork.

47
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,796
After the dancing,

48
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,036
more gift-giving....

49
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,754
weed from the bottom of the lake, a sample
of what the couple intend to contribute

50
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,997
when they make their nest together.

51
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,999
A male swallow-tailed gull
also declares his intentions

52
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,556
with a down-payment on the nest.

53
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,396
As a pair get to know one another better,

54
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,310
they become sufficiently trustful
to indulge in a little mutual preening.

55
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,677
Albatross behave in the same way.

56
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,992
These powerful bills are quite strong enough

57
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,478
to injure anything or anyone
that dares to interfere with the birds.

58
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,592
But now, as the pair sit together
on their nest site,

59
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,554
they are used to deliver
the most tender of caresses.

60
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,312
What follows may seem like duelling...

61
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,030
..but actually it is, once again, a kind of dancing.

62
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,316
The sequence of movements

63
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,829
is long and complicated.

64
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,279
If both partners perform
without mistakes and in harmony,

65
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,198
then, at last, there comes

66
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,675
the most intimate act of all.

67
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,276
Mating in birds

68
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,837
can be a very quick business,
no more than a brief meeting of genital openings.

69
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,113
In albatross, it is unusually leisurely.

70
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,035
So pairs are formed

71
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,993
and the union is consummated.

72
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,833
For most birds, the pair will now
stay together for several weeks,

73
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,996
if not for several years.

74
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,509
In the case of these waved albatross in Galapagos,

75
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,359
they will stay together for the rest of their lives.

76
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,155
And that, when you come
to think of it, is very unusual

77
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,955
Insects don't stay together, frogs and toads don't,

78
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,673
lizards and snakes don't.

79
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,552
Why should birds?

80
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,036
Well, the answer is...there.

81
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,479
No female bird can manage
to fly around with an egg inside her -

82
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,832
let alone several - for the days
or weeks it needs to develop.

83
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,190
As soon as she can, she lays it.

84
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,914
But then caring for it is a major job.

85
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,588
And for these albatross, as for most birds,

86
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,677
it's a job for two.

87
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,838
It would be nice to think that such a devoted pair

88
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,474
were held together by mutual affection.

89
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,752
The evidence, I'm afraid, doesn't support that.

90
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,475
It's not so much the affection
that one bird has for the other,

91
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,478
as the concern it has for its own genes,

92
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,229
which are in the egg the two produced together.

93
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,431
If, without jeopardising those,

94
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,553
either bird could find a way
of spreading its genes more widely,

95
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,194
the evidence suggests they would take it.

96
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,640
Here in Jamaica,
some male birds are far from faithful

97
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,714
Flame trees, when in flower,
produce great quantities

98
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,638
of delicious sweet nectar.

99
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:49,517
It is the staple diet for hummingbirds, and
Jamaica has many different species of them.

100
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,191
The male streamer-tailed hummer
is a vigorous and aggressive creature,

101
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,713
and a particularly strong individual
will take control of an entire tree.

102
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,755
0ther males, of course, have their eyes on it.

103
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,749
But the resident male
won't allow others near his flowers,

104
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,192
even though you might think there
is more than enough for everyone.

105
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,395
But he is not fighting
just because he wants to drink

106
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,511
all the tree's nectar himself.

107
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,711
He is more devious than that.

108
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,788
The tree is the most
prolific source of nectar around.

109
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,110
There are several female
streamer-tails in the neighbourhood,

110
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,711
and they are busy building nests,
which they do entirely by themselves.

111
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,876
They are relatively plain creatures,

112
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,993
lacking the long streamer-like tails of the male.

113
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,631
There is so much nectar around

114
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,751
that when the time comes

115
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,918
they will be able to feed
their chicks single-handed.

116
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,594
But the main supply comes from the flame tree,

117
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,475
and, sooner or later, they all visit it.

118
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,353
The male streamer-tail waits for them to call.

119
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:30,311
As soon as one appears, he shows off
in front of her with a special courtship flight.

120
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,115
He erects little tufts like ears
on either side of his head.

121
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,158
She accepts him.

122
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,277
He goes back to wait for the next diner,

123
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:57,274
while she pulls herself together
and prepares for life as a single parent.

124
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,589
A good secure home
can also be a very effective lure

125
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,916
with which to attract a female.

126
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,590
Red-headed weavers
in Africa often nest in colonies

127
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,076
and when they do, the females,
who have yellow heads,

128
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,070
keep an eye on which male is building
what before committing themselves.

129
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,635
This one is only just starting.

130
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,674
It's too early to judge
his skill as a builder.

131
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,318
This looks promising,
but perhaps it's still too early to tell.

132
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,434
A lot of work goes into each nest.

133
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,279
It's very important
that the weave should be tight.

134
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,631
If it's too loose,
the eggs might drop through.

135
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,710
When one is finished and ready for judging,

136
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,832
the male perches hopefully beside it.

137
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,870
She clearly doesn't
think much of this one.

138
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,399
This, however, is good enough
to warrant an internal inspection.

139
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,151
If she accepts,
she will add the lining herself.

140
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,912
But there are lots of females around,
and as soon as she's settled in,

141
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,714
he starts building another nest.

142
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:51,029
In fact, this particularly skilled and industrious
male has already built three earlier nests,

143
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,711
each of which now holds chicks
that he has fathered.

144
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,835
Each female, by choosing him as a mate,

145
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,989
has provided her young
with the best genetic inheritance available.

146
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:11,159
And he, by keeping on building,
has quadrupled the number of his offspring.

147
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,313
But some birds construct
even bigger buildings to impress females,

148
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,988
and to see the most spectacular of all,

149
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,430
you have to come to the dense forests

150
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,790
of the islands north of Australia.

151
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,357
Some females can be
persuaded to mate for rewards

152
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,791
that are more abstract
than mere food and lodging.

153
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,232
There's a kind of bird here in New Guinea
whose females select a male,

154
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,672
not because he is a better meal-ticket,
but because he is a better artist.

155
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:48,309
How else would you describe this wonderful
construction except as a work of art?

156
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,069
This is its creator, the Vogelcop bowerbird.

157
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,671
He has a passion for interior decoration.

158
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,591
His hut, almost big enough for me to
crawl into, is neither a home nor a nursery.

159
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,952
It is a gallery in which he can display
his artistic creations

160
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,991
to visiting females.

161
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,118
These flowers come from a creeper
that has only just started to bloom,

162
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,596
great new material
for anyone who likes colour.

163
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,358
And he loves it.

164
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,435
The iridescent wing cases
of beetles also appeal to him,

165
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,790
and he has amassed
an impressive collection.

166
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,551
But they are always in need
of a little rearrangement to show them off

167
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,671
to their very best advantage.

168
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,960
He calls to invite female visitors.

169
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,839
There are several such bowers
in this part of the forest.

170
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,675
A hundred yards away, there is another one
built by another male of the same species,

171
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,429
who has a slightly different
artistic sense.

172
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:20,079
If a female decides this is the best selection
of jewels, then she will mate with the owner.

173
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,074
So here, where living is easy,
a female is not bowled over

174
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,670
by practical things
such as food or accommodation.

175
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,711
It's beauty that wins her heart,

176
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,040
and beauty can be found
not only in jewels but in costumes.

177
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:52,197
This is Bulwer's pheasant,
and he's got spectacular wattles.

178
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,075
He's impressive enough when he
is going about his normal business,

179
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,432
but when she is around,
he gets very excited indeed.

180
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,316
Impressive though he is,

181
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,511
she is very critical

182
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,598
He's not good enough, it seems.

183
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,069
Another pheasant,
Temminck's tragopan.

184
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,193
His costume jewellery
is even more elaborate.

185
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,551
And if you've got it, why not flaunt it?

186
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,910
The male monal pheasant impresses
his female with a greater expanse

187
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,477
of unbroken iridescence
than is possessed by any other species.

188
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,473
The argus pheasant
has the largest of all tail feathers,

189
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,515
and wing feathers
that are certainly as spectacular.

190
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,231
And what can rival

191
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,476
the train of a peacock?

192
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,072
The costume put on
specially for courtship dances

193
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,236
by the African widow-bird

194
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,036
may not be quite as extravagant
and unwieldy as those of the pheasants.

195
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,836
But the widow-bird displays
by flying with his.

196
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,196
It's a hazardous business exposing yourself
like this, even if you can fly.

197
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,437
You are making yourself
an easy target for a hawk,

198
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,713
and there are many around
on these grasslands in Kenya.

199
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,431
Evidently the additional matings
a male gets

200
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,710
from displaying in this dangerous fashion

201
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,876
make the risk worthwhile.

202
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,997
Up in the frozen north,
on the Arctic tundra,

203
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,352
life is altogether too rigorous
to allow such extravagance.

204
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,915
Here males display in a more modest way.

205
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,509
The buff-breasted sand-piper.

206
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,995
No spectacular plumes for him.

207
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,358
But, nonetheless,
he has quite an attractive armpit.

208
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,956
Flashes like these can be seen
a good two hundred yards away.

209
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,678
A female has got the message.

210
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,554
She's definitely interested.

211
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,791
Now there are three females.

212
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,195
It's time to reveal all.

213
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,113
He reinforces his appeal
with quiet clicking calls.

214
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,674
More and more females arrive.

215
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,435
Nearby, another male
is having no success whatsoever.

216
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,390
Now there are four females with male
Number 0ne. This hardly seems fair.

217
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,919
There must be something about Number
Two's underwings that doesn't appeal

218
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,678
So he comes over to where the action is.

219
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,638
The females don't know which way to turn.

220
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,792
But Number 0ne won't allow
anyone else on his pitch for long.

221
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,958
There's not room on this part
of the tundra for two.

222
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:10,356
So competing for mates
only too often leads to physical violence.

223
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,312
Scotland. Here in the pine
forests of the Highlands,

224
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,229
fights between males
are among the most violent of all.

225
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,873
The capercaillie is the biggest of grouse.

226
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,911
The arenas on which the males
display are vigorously contested,

227
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,795
and the best, in the end,
is claimed by the most powerful male,

228
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,753
who will defend it against any intruder.

229
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,113
He is so charged up,
this being the breeding season,

230
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,599
that he will display
to almost anything, including me.

231
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,035
Now, now.
Now, now.

232
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,359
But here's a really serious rival

233
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,232
He is being very reckless indeed.

234
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:03,269
Birds can get very badly injured in battles
like these and even die from their wounds,

235
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,233
but the rewards they are fighting for
are very great.

236
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,319
This is the most important
moment of their year.

237
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,070
The females tour the duelling grounds
to select the bonniest fighter of them all.

238
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,398
And they seem to agree
on who the champion is.

239
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,832
Runners-up are almost
universally rejected by the females,

240
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,830
while the winner attracts almost
more mates than he can deal with.

241
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,550
Some males make the job of the females
in choosing between them easier

242
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,752
by gathering together
and displaying in groups.

243
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,748
And there is one bird in the canopy
of the Brazilian rainforest here

244
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,397
who has perhaps the oddest way
of trying to impress the females.

245
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,319
It is called the Calfbird.

246
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,269
(DIN0F BIRDCALLS)

247
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,039
They compete with calls.

248
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,633
The sound is greatly amplified
by air-sacs on their throats.

249
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,593
The skin surrounding the sacs
is so thin that, as they inflate,

250
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,473
you can see right through them.

251
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,119
This assembly is a hundred feet
above the ground, high in the canopy,

252
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,995
so high that very few people
have ever seen the birds

253
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,557
performing this extraordinary chorus,
let alone film it.

254
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,036
The top male, with, presumably,
the best voice,

255
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,196
occupies the best site -

256
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,233
a forked branch totally free of leaves.

257
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,918
The females look exactly
the same as the males,

258
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,635
as you might expect since the males
are not using special costumes

259
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,832
to compete with one another.

260
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,233
When a female flies down to the best branch,

261
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,796
all the males call with renewed intensity.

262
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,469
More females arrive.

263
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,033
A female tells the male she has chosen him
by giving him a peck on the neck.

264
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,434
She flutters to the other branch invitingly.

265
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,191
But he is concentrating so hard on his display
that he doesn't seem to notice her.

266
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,594
She tries again.

267
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,196
That's the idea.

268
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,273
And then he notices a second female.

269
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,110
Call as they might, none of the males
on other branches get a look in.

270
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,072
The Calfbird has a cousin
whose males also display in groups.

271
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,113
They compete not with sound
but with colour.

272
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,711
The cock of the rock.

273
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,514
The males assemble in groups of a dozen
or so, perching low down on lianas,

274
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,635
watching out for females
and squabbling among themselves.

275
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,991
The female is dull-coloured.
She has no use for bright feathers.

276
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,552
Her arrival beside the display ground
has an immediate effect.

277
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,391
The males flop down.

278
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,160
Each one owns a particular patch of ground,

279
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,353
his court, on which he,
and he alone, displays.

280
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,355
Each now has the problem of how
to persuade her to land beside him,

281
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:57,476
and a cock of the rock's idea
for doing that is to bounce competitively.

282
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,478
They adjust their positions slightly
to try and stay in a patch of sunshine

283
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,557
if they possibly can.

284
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,875
0nce again,
a peck on the neck says ''I'm yours''.

285
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,509
And once again, the male
is not very quick on the uptake.

286
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,589
But he gets there eventually.

287
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,874
After this is over, she will go off
and rear her chicks by herself.

288
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,595
Another female.

289
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,878
She makes exactly the same selection.

290
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,197
By gathering together,

291
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,394
the males make sure that the females know
where the marriage market is,

292
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,037
but the price of doing so is that
only one or two males will make a sale.

293
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,077
In just a few species, however,

294
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,272
the males in a neighbourhood
don't compete with one another,

295
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,313
but collaborate to form a team.

296
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,636
This is the blue manakin.

297
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,831
He is the captain of his team
and he whistles to summon the other members.

298
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,110
The team is complete and the show begins.

299
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:49,276
They are striving to prove that they are the
best team of acrobats in the neighbourhood.

300
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,553
A female arrives. She is going to get
a close-up view of the performance

301
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,399
from the actual dancing perch.

302
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,111
If she is sufficiently impressed,
she will mate with the captain.

303
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,276
But why should the assistants help him?

304
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,789
Because if something happens
to the captain,

305
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,992
one of them will have
the chance to inherit his position.

306
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,952
It may not be a large chance,

307
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,628
but it is better than performing solo

308
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,195
and having no chance at all.

309
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,508
That's enough to show how expert they are,

310
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,474
so the captain dismisses
his assistants with another special call.

311
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,271
If the lady decides to accept him,
she will mate with him nearby.

312
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,232
She will then fly away

313
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,399
and he willjust keep on dancing,
hoping for another success.

314
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,273
He will never knowingly see his offspring.

315
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,600
But not all polygamous birds
are so neglectful of their parental duties.

316
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,954
Here on the pampas of Argentina
lives another male with many wives

317
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,109
who takes his nursery duties
very seriously indeed.

318
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:25,314
These eggs are all
looked after by one single male.

319
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,798
And even now he is trying to entice
another female to come here

320
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,436
and add another egg to this huge clutch.

321
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,952
He's a Rhea, a South American ostrich,
and he's mating with one of the group

322
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,435
he has managed
to attract into his territory.

323
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,471
Tomorrow she will lay.

324
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,439
The whole party now moves towards his nest.

325
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,959
He settles down to continue incubating.

326
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,712
And one of the females
with whom he mated yesterday

327
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,388
is now ready to lay.

328
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,955
She settles down

329
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,196
within a yard or so of the nest.

330
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,751
An egg is on its way.

331
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,039
She leaves,

332
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,869
and he rolls her egg into the nest

333
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,911
to join the rest of his collection

334
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,190
contributed by his other wives.

335
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,073
He may accumulate
as many as forty of them.

336
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,395
Because the male
has taken total charge of the nest,

337
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,558
the females can be
just as promiscuous as he is,

338
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,354
and that female, having laid here,

339
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,314
will now be going away to find
another male with another nest

340
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,353
to see if he will accept another egg.

341
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,318
That's unusual behaviour for a male,

342
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,548
taking total responsibility
for incubation and for chick rearing.

343
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,876
0n the tundra of the Arctic, however,

344
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:39,995
another species has taken
this reversal of roles further still.

345
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,160
These are red phalaropes.

346
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,155
In almost any other species,

347
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,271
you would be right to think

348
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,393
that the bird with the brighter markings
on its head and neck is the male.

349
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,593
And that judgment will be reinforced

350
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,873
when you see two brighter birds
fighting in front of a duller coloured one.

351
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,036
That's typical male behaviour.

352
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:21,311
But the truth becomes apparent
when you see them mating.

353
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,796
It's the duller coloured one
who mounts on the other's back.

354
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,468
It's the duller one who is the male.

355
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,430
That is the female.

356
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:43,477
He now goes away
to the nest that he has already built.

357
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,718
The brighter coloured female comes
back to him for several days thereafter,

358
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,151
to mate again
and to add more eggs to the nest.

359
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,509
While she sits, he stands aside.

360
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,835
Now it will be up to him,

361
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,315
and him alone, to incubate the eggs

362
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,397
and look after the chicks.

363
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,798
No one really understands why the phalaropes,
almost alone among birds,

364
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,195
have reversed the role of the sexes.

365
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,837
But mating openly with multiple partners

366
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,678
is the exception.

367
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,395
In most species, both male and female
are needed to bring up the young,

368
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,989
so most birds after mating stay together as a pair,

369
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,510
at least during the breeding season.

370
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,670
An indication that this is
the basis of their relationship

371
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,917
is that the sexes
are broadly similar in appearance.

372
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:54,639
But even so, living as a pair doesn't
preclude a little infidelity, now and then.

373
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,350
Perhaps the most bizarre behaviour of all

374
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,155
takes place
in the suburban gardens of England,

375
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,638
and it seems that until very recently,
nobody even noticed.

376
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:14,314
A young female hedge-sparrow,
a dunnock, ready to lay.

377
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,470
This is her mate, Alpha, singing lustily,

378
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,752
declaring his ownership
of the nest and the territory around it

379
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,598
from which he gathers food.

380
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,196
The pair often feed together,
a devoted couple if ever you saw one.

381
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,633
He seldom lets her out of his sight,

382
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,991
for she is not as faithful as she might be.

383
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,715
There's a third bird around -
Beta, another, younger male.

384
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:07,552
He's not popular with Alpha
and they're continually squabbling.

385
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,911
Sometimes the fights can get
quite vicious and feathers fly.

386
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,311
But in spite of that, Beta stays around,

387
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,556
skulking in the hedge.

388
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,193
Alpha, it seems,
has the female to himself once more.

389
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,712
But she has got her eye cocked.

390
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,673
Beta is still in the hedge,
calling quietly to her.

391
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,395
She joins him, and now,
while Alpha is preoccupied with feeding,

392
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,875
she and Beta get together.

393
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:00,232
Twirling her tail is an invitation,
and in a split second they mate.

394
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,435
Beta flies away.

395
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,630
But now, out in the open,

396
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,913
she is courting Alpha
with that same old tail twirling.

397
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,869
He takes precautions
to ensure his paternity.

398
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,274
He pecks her genital opening.

399
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,991
And she eventually ejects a droplet.

400
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,872
It's Beta's sperm.

401
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,670
He persists for up to two minutes
until his rival's sperm is all gone.

402
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,916
And now he mates with her.

403
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,192
It will be his sperm that will fertilise her eggs.

404
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,834
She has kept two males happy,

405
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,396
both of whom will help to feed
the young when they hatch,

406
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,318
and Alpha has managed to ensure

407
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,478
that he will be the father of the eggs
she will soon lay,

408
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,752
or, at any rate, most of them.

409
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,115
But it is here in the south east
woodlands of Australia

410
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,838
that infidelity reaches its most astounding,
indeed, you might think, its ultimate height.

411
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,439
And it occurs among the families
of this dazzling little bird...

412
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,913
the superb fairy wren.

413
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:47,639
He is an attentive male,
courting his female with little gifts of food.

414
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,750
But there are other males around,

415
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,509
identifiable by the different rings on their legs.

416
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:06,553
0ne of them dances for her,
flaring the blue fans on his cheeks.

417
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,752
Yet another male is also flirting with her.

418
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,593
And here's another.

419
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,197
And she selects one of them.

420
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,837
But her first, established male,
is not around to see all this.

421
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,271
He is visiting a female neighbour,
and what is more,

422
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,755
he's carrying a bouquet, a flower petal,

423
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,315
something he never does at home.

424
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,637
And his flashy courtship
behaviour pays off, too.

425
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,993
Now he is back beside his own nest
and with his first mate,

426
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,273
looking after the chicks
that the nest now contains.

427
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,870
So the female fairy wren

428
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,868
chooses the flashiest males to father her chicks,

429
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,675
and allows her partner
only just enough matings

430
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,110
to ensure he helps to feed the family.

431
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:45,189
And the males, while they may have chicks
in as many as six nests around here,

432
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,837
may not have a single one
in the nest that they actually tend.

433
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,635
They say it is a wise child
that knows its own father,

434
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,798
but that is never more true
than in the bird world.

435
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,591
But extreme infidelity, like polygamy,
is not widespread among birds.

436
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,593
Among swans, as amongst most birds,
male and female stay together.

437
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,190
And by a combination
of bonding with one another

438
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:21,350
and driving away any who try to interfere
with the partnership, they stay together.

439
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,598
Male and female
conduct their courtship on equal terms,

440
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,109
and when they are convinced
they are compatible,

441
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,392
they work together to build a nest.

442
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,750
Protected on most sides by water,

443
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,111
and with a strong and aggressive mate
to see off intruders,

444
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,915
these swans will probably
hatch their egg successfully.

445
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:58,478
But for many birds, they are now entering
on the most difficult part of their lives.

446
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:03,549
They will have to employ all kind of ingenious
stratagems if they are to raise a family,

447
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:09,471
as we will see in the next programme
in The Life of Birds.
