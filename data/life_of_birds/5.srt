
2
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,077
Birds are masters of the air and can gather
food from anywhere on the land.

3
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,229
But most of the earth is covered with water
and so some birds, early in their history,

4
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,195
became extremely competent there too,
both in it and on it.

5
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,916
These shallow gravelly streams
here, in the New Zealand Alps

6
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,715
seem desolate places devoid of any food.

7
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,037
But look at the underside of this pebble
I've just picked up;

8
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,959
Several succulent insect larvae.

9
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:42,430
And in fact, these streams, like waters
fresh or salt all over the world, are full of food.

10
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,510
When you consider that two thirds of the world
is covered with water, that's a huge resource.

11
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,397
No group of animals living out of water
have developed a wider range of techniques,

12
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,593
and indeed tools for, collecting that food
than the birds.

13
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,470
This one is unique. The only beak
in the entire bird world that is bent to one side.

14
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,798
This is the wrybill, which
only lives here in New Zealand.

15
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,270
Its extraordinary beak enables it to probe
beneath large heavy boulders

16
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,029
that it couldn't possibly turn over or even shift.

17
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,875
And just in case you're wondering,
the bend is always to the right.

18
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,469
Dippers plunge right into the streams.

19
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,037
This one is in Yellowstone, in the American West,

20
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,074
where hot volcanic springs keep
the streams clear of ice in winter,

21
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,432
so that the dippers can walk underwater
throughout the year.

22
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,674
Their dense, oily plumage retains air
to such a degree

23
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,352
that it forms a silvery cloak around their body
and so keeps the birds warm.

24
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,235
The disadvantage of that coat of air is that
it makes its wearer very buoyant,

25
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,036
and the dipper has to struggle hard
to remain below the surface.

26
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,317
They seldom manage to stay underwater for
much more than a quarter of a minute at a time.

27
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,475
Kingfishers are only underwater for a second or so.
They are living harpoons.

28
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,434
This is one of the bigger members of the family,
the belted kingfisher.

29
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,192
It's the size of a small crow, and lives beside
rivers and lakes all over North America.

30
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,788
Understandably, it prefers places where the water
is clear so it can get a good view of its targets.

31
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,996
Having caught the fish, it must now stun it,
and to do that the fish has to be head outwards.

32
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,838
But if the kingfisher is to swallow it
without the spiny fins sticking in its throat,

33
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,679
it has to turn the fish around again.

34
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,557
Most kingfishers dive from perches. That means
that they are more or less tied to the shore.

35
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,672
0nly one of them is able to break that link.

36
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,637
This is the African pied kingfisher, and
it can launch its dive from high in the sky

37
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,958
because, even in completely still air,
it can hover.

38
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,509
It's the biggest bird in the world
to be able to do this.

39
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,513
It's not only a diver, sometimes it's a juggler.

40
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,036
The darter does its harpooning underwater.

41
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,314
It's so at home there, that
it can actually creep up on its prey.

42
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,791
Missed.

43
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,593
It always has to juggle to get its catch
off its harpoon.

44
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,596
The darter doesn't have the dipper's problem
with buoyancy

45
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,156
because its feathers actually absorb water.

46
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,877
But that means that it gets soaked to the skin,

47
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,436
and after a swim,
like anyone in a wet bathing costume,

48
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,952
it has to dry itself quickly and thoroughly
if it's not to get a chill.

49
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,112
Some fish are incurably inquisitive.

50
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,669
The little egret can attract them by doing
no more than waggle its yellow feet.

51
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,636
It seems a simple enough trick,
but it works nonetheless.

52
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,115
Birds all over the world have devised
all kinds of bizarre solutions

53
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,711
to the problem of extracting little fish
from shallow pools.

54
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,675
In the swamps of Florida, the reddish egret
performs an improbable kind of dance.

55
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,160
The idea seems to be to frighten the little fish
out of their hiding places.

56
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,396
Shading your eyes can help you see
what's down there, beneath the reflections.

57
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,869
And there was something.

58
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,314
In Africa, the black heron takes the business
of shading its eyes very seriously indeed.

59
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,032
Maybe cutting out reflections is
not the only reason for doing this.

60
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,233
Many fish prefer to swim beneath
an overhanging bank or a tree,

61
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,193
so they can't be easily seen from above.

62
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,313
So perhaps they deliberately take shelter
under the heron's wings,

63
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,909
which, of course, could be a mistake.

64
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,273
The spoonbill isn't really after fish.

65
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,316
This scything action of its beak enables it to
gather tadpoles, beetles and insect larvae,

66
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,957
but it must also scare little fish,
which then dash off to seek safety.

67
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,757
So it's worthwhile for the black heron to
follow the spoonbill around, just in case.

68
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,110
The pygmy cormorant certainly is after fish,

69
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,839
and therefore thinks it's a good idea to follow
the heron. Maybe the heron is having better luck.

70
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,032
All in all, a little fish doesn't stand
much of a chance in a shallow pool like this.

71
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,830
These too are fishermen,
but they don't wade, they skim.

72
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,830
And to do that they need not long legs,
but a long beak.

73
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:07,598
0r to be more accurate, a long, lower mandible.
The upper one is more or less normal in size.

74
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,430
This is the skimmer,
a highly specialised relation of the gulls.

75
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,909
Their chicks, in fact, look very like gull chicks.

76
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:34,310
They don't develop that extraordinary beak
until they are some three months old.

77
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,388
Skimming, although it demands
flying of the greatest precision,

78
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,955
is straightforward enough in principle.

79
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,516
As soon as the lower mandible, ploughing
through the surface of the water,

80
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,396
touches anything solid,
a reflex action will make it snap shut.

81
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,356
That sounds fine, but supposing
the beak hits something really big,

82
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,076
like a floating twig or, worse, a submerged rock,
what then?

83
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,876
Well, the fact is, that quite a lot of skimmers
have broken mandibles.

84
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,831
Whatever the hazards, overall,
the technique is a very succesful one.

85
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,910
The chicks have to be fed for six weeks and
skimmers are faithful, hardworking parents,

86
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,274
bringing food every ten minutes or so,
for hours on end when the fishing is good.

87
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,631
But while they are certainly devoted
to their young,

88
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,799
they are sometimes just a little optimistic.

89
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,312
0h well, if baby doesn't want it....

90
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:42,034
Skimmers and egrets and kingfishers
live beside the water.

91
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,674
Some birds live actually on it.

92
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,910
Mallards must be one of the most familiar birds
in the world.

93
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,476
Because of that, perhaps we tend to
take ducks for granted.

94
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,114
But in fact, they are a very varied family.

95
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,871
Different species are adapted to
different ways of life on water.

96
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,595
Mallards, for example, are specialist dabblers.

97
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:12,555
They find all the food they need by doing no more
than dipping their heads beneath the surface.

98
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:19,632
And there's lots of food to be found that way;
duckweed, tadpoles, weeds and seeds,

99
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,389
and bits of bread thrown in by friendly humans.

100
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,673
If the food they have spotted is really deep down,
they will up-end totally.

101
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,271
If that doesn't get it,
it's beyond their reach and that's that.

102
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:03,234
Ducks keep their plumage water-resistant by
anointing it with oil from a gland on their rump.

103
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,959
They also keep their feathers clean, soft and pliant
by frequent and enthusiastic bathing.

104
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,871
Ducks don't alljust dabble. Some dive deeper.

105
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,354
The merganser has webbed feet,
like the mallard and all other ducks,

106
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,154
but they are placed very far back on the body.

107
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,194
That's the best place to have a propeller
from a mechanical point of view,

108
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,996
and as a result they can swim quite fast enough
to catch small fish.

109
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,992
Their bills are notched like a fine saw,

110
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,875
which helps when you have to grapple
with a slippery fish.

111
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,231
The young start diving
almost as soon as they've hatched.

112
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,434
But they're still covered in down, and that makes
swimming underwater very difficult indeed.

113
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,315
They use up far more energy
than their streamlined parents do.

114
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,596
The most skilful underwater swimmer of
all freshwater birds, however, is the diver.

115
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,874
This is an immature one, that has not yet got
its spectacular black and white plumage.

116
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,234
Its feet are placed so far back on its body,
that out of water it can hardly walk,

117
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,194
but underwater it's superbly manoeuvrable.

118
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,312
Small fish have little chance.

119
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,277
That's very useful for keeping warm,
it can be very windy out there on the lake.

120
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,234
But as the mergansers demonstrated,
it causes problems when diving.

121
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,910
And young divers don't even try.

122
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,995
Diver chicks, it has to be said,
are rather pampered.

123
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,316
They're regularly given lifts.

124
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,514
And while one of their parents ferries
them around, the other finds food for them.

125
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,477
The male finds a fish, but
decides to eat that himself.

126
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,194
He's been away a long time
and the family is getting hungry.

127
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,829
But now he's found a crayfish.
That will do for them.

128
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,318
The crayfish is carefully broken up, and passed
over to the chicks a little piece at a time,

129
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,911
with great delicacy, and quite a lot of patience.

130
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,753
They get shallower
as rivers dump sediment in them,

131
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,951
and in the tropics,
they may even dry up every year.

132
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,756
As a result, all sorts of delicious things come
within reach, as they have in this African pool

133
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,872
The openbill stork has a special liking for mussels,
and a special way of opening them.

134
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,119
First, a sharp squeeze to make
the shell open slightly.

135
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:22,075
Then the lower mandible is slipped in,
to cut the body away from the shell.

136
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,550
After that, it's easy.

137
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,599
Snails require a slightly different treatment.

138
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,360
To start with, they have to be taken
on to solid ground.

139
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,549
Now the little disc, with which the snail
can seal its shell, has to be removed.

140
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,878
That's done by delicately squeezing it
in just the right place.

141
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,513
There!

142
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:18,149
Then, once again, the muscle that attaches
the snail to its shell has got to be severed.

143
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,828
And out it comes.

144
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,230
As the dry season progresses,
yellow-billed storks travel in flocks,

145
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,874
from one drying river bed to another.

146
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,389
When the water started to shallow,
many of the fish retreated to the main river.

147
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,195
Those that didn't are now trapped and doomed.

148
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,350
The yellow-bills have a labour-saving technique
for fishing in these overcrowded pools.

149
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:04,554
They just hold their beaks open and
wait for a fish to blunder into them.

150
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,670
0nly one kind of fish is likely to survive
the coming drought.

151
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,429
The lungfish will soon cocoon itself
in the mud at the bottom,

152
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,760
and remain there, dormant but still alive,
even when the river bed is bone dry,

153
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,872
because it can breathe air.

154
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,956
But before it cocoons,
it has to survive another peril

155
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,472
The shoebill stork
has a massive and murderous beak.

156
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,714
It also has keen eyes.

157
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,711
And infinite patience.

158
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,148
0ne bite crushes the lungfish's skull.

159
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:02,190
But it still wriggles and takes
quite a bit of swallowing.

160
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:34,718
0n the margins of the land, the water retreats
not just once a year, but twice every day.

161
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,276
That exposes a completely different menu,

162
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,314
and birds compete in order to be
the first to collect it.

163
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,789
Here in California, there are some that take
almost suicidal risks in order to do so.

164
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,552
The surf bird is the clear winner.

165
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:08,153
No bird gets to an edible morsel
cast up by the waves quicker than it does.

166
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,910
It has split-second judgement.

167
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,718
It may also be that it gets so close to the waves

168
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,708
because that gives it the chance of catching
a barnacle or a mussel,

169
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,675
before it has fully reacted to its exposure
to the air, and closed its shell.

170
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,117
Where the coast is less rocky and the beaches
are sandier, the waves are less violent.

171
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,633
Here birds of several different kinds will
assemble, but they are not always in competition.

172
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,550
Each collects from a particular place
with a particular kind of implement.

173
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,912
The godwits have long beaks with
which to probe deeply into the sand

174
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,669
for worms, crustaceans and little molluscs.

175
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,516
Dowitchers, with shorter beaks, collect the same
sort of thing but from nearer the surface.

176
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,360
Sanderlings pick up bits and pieces
that have just been washed ashore.

177
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:40,108
0ut in the shallow water, avocets are after
shrimps, and other swimming creatures

178
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,676
that don't allow themselves to get stranded
on the beach.

179
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,871
The avocet holds its bill
with the curved section just slightly parted,

180
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,438
and as it sweeps it through the water and
the mud, small invertebrates are carried into it.

181
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:02,273
The bill is so sensitive that the avocet feels when
something good has arrived, and swallows it.

182
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,755
Fish also come into the coastal shallows,
seeking the same sort of thing.

183
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,709
And when they do,
they become the target of pelicans.

184
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,994
With a bill the size of a pelican's,
you don't have to have pin-point accuracy.

185
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,148
It does help, however,
for pelicans to feed in groups,

186
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,673
for then fish fleeing from one lunging bill
may blunder into another.

187
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,598
The brown pelican also dives.

188
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:55,431
But rather clumsily. It's so big and buoyant,
that it only goes a few feet down.

189
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,710
It's very often accompanied by noddy terns.

190
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,198
They know that the pelican has to open its bill
and get rid of all that water

191
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,153
before it can swallow any fish
it might have caught.

192
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,115
And when it does, they might get a chance
to steal part of its catch.

193
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,272
So now it's a question of who loses patience first.

194
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,238
The pelican cautiously opens its billjust slightly,

195
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,716
and the water begins to seep from its pouch.

196
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,636
Done it, this time.

197
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:28,356
Boobies live on the coast, but their
fishing grounds are way out in the open ocean.

198
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:36,034
Every morning they leave their roosts and set off
in small parties to scour the surface of the sea.

199
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,549
They are searching for a pale greenish patch
in the blue of the ocean

200
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,230
that betrays the presence of a dense shoal of fish.

201
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:56,756
The fish have been driven to the surface
by a shark that is still lunging into the shoal

202
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,078
And now they are subject
to an aerial bombardment.

203
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,233
As the boobies dive, they draw their wings
half back so that they can still aim,

204
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,910
and only fully retract them
just before they hit the water.

205
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,520
The bombardment will continue until either
the shoal manages to escape downwards,

206
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,589
or the fading light of the evening forces
the boobies to return to their roost on the coast.

207
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,309
Boobies don't actively swim underwater,

208
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,672
but members of the auk family,
such as these guillemots and puffins, do.

209
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:59,834
They propel themselves, not with their feet,
like ducks, but with their wings,

210
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,396
and they have paid a considerable price
to be able to do so.

211
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:10,995
The wings of a booby or a gull are far too long
and insufficiently robust to be beaten underwater.

212
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,239
So auks have had to evolve
shorter, stubbier wings.

213
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,910
That gives them a rather clumsy,
whirring flight in the air

214
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:25,798
but it does enable them to fly underwater so well
that they can outpace small fish.

215
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,273
0ne family of birds has taken
this development even farther,

216
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,076
and one of them lives here...in the Galapagos.

217
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,558
We tend to think of penguins as sitting around
on ice floes in the freezing waters of the Antarctic,

218
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:01,710
so maybe these little penguins sitting
right on the equator seem odd to us.

219
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,199
But in fact, these little ones are probably
much more like the original ancestral penguin

220
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,119
than their giant Antarctic cousins.

221
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:16,998
Because those first ancestral penguins certainly
flew, as well as dived, as guillemots do today.

222
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,273
And if you were much bigger than this
and had a wing shaped like a flipper,

223
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,393
which is what all penguins need to swim,
you would never get into the air.

224
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:31,118
So maybe these little ones
are more like the first of the penguins.

225
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,674
Penguins underwater look somewhat like dolphins

226
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,431
and indeed the two families
have similar evolutionary histories.

227
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,315
Dolphins are descended
from air-breathing land animals,

228
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,513
just as penguins are descended
from air-breathing flying animals.

229
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,757
Both subsequently
took to swimming for their food.

230
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,349
They became beautifully adapted and streamlined.

231
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,998
And now, both are superlative swimmers
and highly accomplished fishermen.

232
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:53,190
Some members of the penguin family can dive
for 5-6 minutes without taking breath

233
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,995
and descend to depths of a thousand feet
in search of food.

234
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:13,476
Indeed, the only thing that limits penguins
as swimmers, is their need to breathe air.

235
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:19,198
There is, however, one link that still ties them,
and indeed all birds, to the land.

236
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,473
They all have to return there
in order to lay their eggs.

237
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,514
For sea birds, the ideal place to do that
is a remote island

238
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,316
which has very few, or preferably
no land-living predators.

239
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,036
(IMITATES BIRD CALLS)

240
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,713
Nobody knows why it happens,

241
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:56,199
but when you make strange noises here,
sea birds fall from the sky.

242
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:03,033
I'm on Lord Howe Island, a tiny speck of land
300 miles off the east coast of Australia.

243
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,277
Human beings only got here
little over 200 years ago,

244
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,759
and it seems that the birds that nest here
are still quite curious to see what's going on.

245
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,114
And these birds which are coming
to these calls are Providence petrels.

246
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,558
Skilled in the air they may be, but they
are certainly clumsy and ungainly on land.

247
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,311
When they do come down, they squabble
and wrestle furiously with one another.

248
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,718
Perhaps they're arguing about who shall have
which patch for a nest hole.

249
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,238
But they are still extraordinarily friendly
towards human beings.

250
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,514
And, amazingly and very touchingly,

251
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,190
it will stay here on my hand
in a very trusting way

252
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,872
and it gives me a chance to look at the structure
at the base of its beak.

253
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,514
It has a tube-nose, and that structure,

254
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,395
which it shares with a number
of other ocean-going birds,

255
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:30,628
is absolutely crucial to their survival
out on the open ocean.

256
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,628
And that is where he is going to go right now.

257
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,119
That tube channels air to a sense organ
at the base of the beak

258
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,392
which can detect very faint odours.

259
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,955
That's a rare ability among birds,

260
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:08,678
and it enables the tube-noses to find
floating food from great distances away.

261
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,915
I'm at sea, 20 miles out
from the east coast of Australia,

262
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:34,193
and in this bucket I've got
a particularly attractive liquid.

263
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,477
It's, eh, fish oil, it's very nutritious.

264
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:46,518
Being oil, it'll float on the surface of the sea,
and above all, it smells very powerfully.

265
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,190
And at the moment there's not a bird in sight.

266
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,790
But watch what happens
when I put it overboard.

267
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,512
The first to arrive are sooty shearwaters
and Cape petrels,

268
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,793
closely related to those Providence petrels
on Lord Howe Island.

269
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,873
It's not only the smell of fish oil and offal
to which they are sensitive.

270
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,471
It's recently been discovered that when
small shrimps and other floating creatures

271
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:49,310
feed on floating plants, algae,
those plants release a gas,

272
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,513
that in strong concentrations
smells a little like rotting seaweed.

273
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,235
The petrels can sense even a faintest whiff of this,

274
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,433
and so can find places
where they can collect the shrimps.

275
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,274
Now very much bigger ocean-going birds arrive.

276
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,799
These magnificent birds are albatrosses.

277
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,189
They, too, belong to the tube-nose family, but
the tube on their beaks is comparatively small.

278
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,110
In fact, they find their food
more by sight than by smell.

279
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,470
They have enormous wing spans.

280
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,399
Two of them, the royal albatross
and the wandering albatross,

281
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,479
have the biggest wing span of any living bird.

282
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,958
And they circle the globe in search of food.

283
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:15,875
This is a yellow-nosed albatross.
It's not quite as big as a wanderer

284
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:20,358
but it's still a very large bird,
with a seven foot wing span.

285
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,156
No birds exploit the ocean winds with greater skill
than the albatrosses.

286
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:32,514
Reading its force with peerless sensitivity,
they're able to adjust their immense wings

287
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,236
to exploit every tiny updraft
deflected from the waves beneath.

288
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,595
So they can glide for long periods without
expending any energy at all on flapping.

289
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,991
The wandering albatross rides
the violent gales of the southern ocean,

290
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,069
and will travel a thousand miles to bring back
a cropful of food for its chick.

291
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:17,593
The chick takes nearly ten months to grow
strong enough for an ocean-going life.

292
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:23,909
So although the albatross, when young, may roam
the oceans for several years without touching land,

293
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,999
eventually the need to breed
brings it down to earth.

294
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,394
0ne bird has managed to break
this long obligation

295
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:39,071
to return repeatedly to land
to feed its chick.

296
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:45,992
It's called the ancient murrelet, and
it doesn't feed its chick on land at all.

297
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:51,228
The only place it nests are on islands
around the northern rim of the Pacific,

298
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,194
like Canada's Queen Charlotte Islands,
where I am now.

299
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,915
And the only time you are likely to see it,
is at night.

300
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:07,030
This is one of their nest holes.
The chicks, when they're only two days old,

301
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,869
make one of the most astonishing journeys
made by any chicks.

302
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,238
The parents come back from the sea at night and,

303
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,876
crouching on the ground,
call to their newly hatched young.

304
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,509
In response, the chicks
come out of their holes, running.

305
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:33,395
There are large aggressive mice that
will catch them if they get the chance.

306
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,195
Ravens and eagles are also active
during these light nights.

307
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,474
The chicks are in real danger.
So they run, and run fast.

308
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,958
Their parents have gone ahead of them,
and are now calling from the sea.

309
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,678
By midnight there are young chicks swarming
all over the forest floor.

310
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:23,396
Most of them managed to get to the beach
within ten minutes of leaving their holes.

311
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,430
But their parents are not here.

312
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:36,395
They've gone farther out, just beyond
the breakers, and they're still calling.

313
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,513
The chicks don't stop. They keep pedalling,
like little clockwork toys,

314
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,636
and the same movements that propelled them
across the ground now take them out to sea.

315
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,479
In some miraculous way, each chick
recognises the sound of its parents' voice.

316
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,113
United, the little families
leave the land and its dangers

317
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,598
and sail away into the relative safety
of the open ocean.

318
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,519
The chicks are still only a few hours old.

319
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:36,511
The ancient murrelet must be
the most truly oceanic of all birds.

320
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,710
Dawn, and there's not a single one
of those little chicks to be seen.

321
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:56,758
By now they are all at least four miles out to sea,
called there by their parents.

322
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,637
Sound, of course, is very important in the life
of all birds. It's the way they communicate.

323
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,958
And what they say, and the various ways
in which they say it,

324
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:13,633
is what we'll be looking at
in the next programme about The Life 0f Birds.
