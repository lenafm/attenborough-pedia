1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,480


3
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,677
Getting into the air is not easy.

4
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,476
For many birds it is by far the most exhausting
bit of the whole business of flight.

5
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,959
But these shearwaters here in Japan
have adopted a very labour-saving way...

6
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,756
Whoops! There we go,
a labour-saving way of doing so.

7
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,350
They've taken to climbing trees.

8
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,879
This particular tree is by far
the most suitable for the take-off,

9
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,676
and that bird may have come
from as far as 30 or 40 yards away,

10
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,910
wandering across the forest floor
in order to climb it and get to the launch pad.

11
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,669
There's another.

12
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,671
40 feet up, a bend in the trunk
makes a perfect platform for a take-off.

13
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,559
These shearwaters
will spend most of their lives in the air.

14
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,357
They are true seabirds.
They only come to land in order to nest.

15
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,269
This particular species is
exceptional in nesting in woodland,

16
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,517
most of them nest right on the edge of cliffs

17
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,714
and all of them get into the air
by the simple method of simply falling into space.

18
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,549
The land birds, on the other hand,
have much greater problems.

19
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,470
Most of them have to be able to get into the air
from the ground with a standing start.

20
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,319
And that takes a lot more energy.

21
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,830
A pigeon begins by jumping vertically upwards.

22
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,272
As it leaves the ground,
it opens its wings and sweeps them forward,

23
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,631
fanning the air downwards with maximum force.

24
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,716
The second stroke must be equally vigorous,
pushing the bird upwards.

25
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,355
If now it leans forward
and starts to go ahead.

26
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,358
But the effort involved has been huge.

27
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,192
Birds only a little bigger than a pigeon
can't do this twice in quick succession.

28
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,791
And a bird as big as an albatross
can't do it at all.

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,710
It has to use yet another way
of getting into the air.

30
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,669
It taxies, along a runway.

31
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,838
It's a method we use too, in our machines.

32
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,994
For the majority of birds
the most exhausting part of flight is now over.

33
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,797
Those shearwaters achieved it by climbing trees,
the pigeon jumped and flapped,

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,758
and aeroplanes and albatross did it by running
and creating a flow of air over their wings.

35
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,875
When they do actually get into the air,
a bird's flight seems almost effortless.

36
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,390
And when you watch
a really superb flyer like these albatross,

37
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,072
then they seem to be defying the law of nature.
They are, after all, big heavy birds.

38
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,352
How is it that they
can withstand the pull of gravity

39
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,632
that keeps the rest of us
tied so firmly to the ground?

40
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,715
The secret is a wing
with a thick, rounded front edge

41
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,198
that curves gently downwards
towards the back edge, which is very thin.

42
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,789
As thin, in fact, as a feather.

43
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,717
As the bird glides forward,

44
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,277
the air flowing under the wing is impeded
by the wing's downward curve.

45
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,031
So it becomes slightly compressed
and that pushes the wing up.

46
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,150
At the same time,
the air flowing across the top of the wing

47
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,480
is deflected upwards by the wing's front edge
so reducing its pressure.

48
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,719
If the air is moving fast enough,
then the slight suction from above

49
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,596
combined with the push from beneath
will be enough to lift the bird into the air,

50
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,920
as it did during take-off,
and ample to keep it aloft, as it's doing now.

51
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,353
The trick is to make sure that the air
does flow over the wing sufficiently quickly.

52
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,915
Upward air currents
can also sustain a bird in flight

53
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,717
and that is just what are created when
breezes, blowing in from the sea, hit a cliff.

54
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,595
If they are really strong,
such up-draughts can be so powerful

55
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,429
that they alone will keep an albatross in the air.

56
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,839
0ut at sea, the waves deflect the wind upwards
in somewhat smaller gusts

57
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,556
and the albatross is so skilful
that it can sail on them for hours

58
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,513
with scarcely a movement of its wings.

59
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,995
Most birds, however, once in flight,

60
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,034
have to create that air-flow across their wings
by another method.

61
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,835
They drive themselves forward by flapping.

62
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:23,036
This knot is 'rowing' through the air, stretching
its wings forwards, and beating them downwards.

63
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,196
0n the upstroke it half-folds them,

64
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,598
to reduce their surface area
and therefore their resistance to the air.

65
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,952
The feathers on its wing
slide smoothly over one another

66
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,391
so that although
the wing is continuously changing shape,

67
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,036
its surface remains
perfectly smooth and streamlined.

68
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,990
Its body is also streamlined
by its coat of feathers,

69
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,877
and its feet are pressed against its tail
so that drag is kept to a minimum.

70
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:00,275
This mallard is flying at nearly 40 miles an hour,
but its streamlining is so perfect

71
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,472
that there is scarcely a ruffle to its feathers.

72
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,870
It's only from behind that you notice
the little flicks of the feathers over its tail

73
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,438
and the back edge of its wings
which show just how fast it's travelling.

74
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,831
To see just how important streamlining is,
and how much energy it can save,

75
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,635
just watch this osprey as it goes fishing.

76
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,193
To take off again, with the fish in its talons,

77
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,279
the bird has to beat its wings
with all the strength it can muster.

78
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,912
But even now it is in the air,
the fish hanging broadside.

79
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,753
It creates so much drag that the osprey has
great difficulty in making any headway at all.

80
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,715
But it knows how to solve the problem.

81
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:26,790
Gripping the fish with just one foot,
it manages to bring its other foot forward.

82
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,155
Now, using both feet, the bird changes
the position of the fish so that it faces ahead

83
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,716
and its streamlined shape
reduces its drag so much

84
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,277
that the osprey's wing-beats
become almost leisurely.

85
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,989
Flying in formation also saves energy.

86
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,273
A big bird like a pelican
creates a trail of turbulence in the air

87
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,438
and this can give a following bird lift.

88
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,633
The effect is at its greatest
directly behind a bird's wing-tip,

89
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,469
so that is the best place for a following bird to fly.

90
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:09,119
Pelicans also save some 20% of
their energy by mixing flapping with gliding.

91
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,799
Aerodynamically it's more profitable for a bird
to time its flaps with those of the bird ahead.

92
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,076
So it is the pelicans who give breathtaking
displays of synchronised formation flying.

93
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,713
The most economical way of flying, however,

94
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,074
is to draw almost all the energy you need
directly from the sun.

95
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,432
As it warms the ground in the morning,
the rocks reflect its heat

96
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,430
and shimmering columns of air,
thermals, begin to rise.

97
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,753
Griffin vultures in Spain now leave the ledges
on the cliffs where they have spent the night

98
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,394
and launch themselves into the air.

99
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,633
With the thermals rising powerfully
beneath their outstretched wings

100
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,628
they sail effortlessly upwards.

101
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,355
All they have to do is to make sure
that they remain within the column of warm air.

102
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,313
So dozens of them spiral together in tight circles,

103
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,310
adjusting their flight with
the tiniest movements of their wings and tails.

104
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,389
There can be no more economical flight than this.

105
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,391
The vulture's ability to 'read' the air conditions
above their landscape,

106
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:38,153
and detect exactly where the thermals are
at their most powerful, seems almost uncanny.

107
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,876
But in recent years,
human beings have also mastered it.

108
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,868
When you hit a thermal in a glider,
you really feel it.

109
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,833
Your stomach drops beneath your feet.

110
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,275
- 0ohh!
- I'm going to roll into the thermal here.

111
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,031
Glider pilots spend a lot of time
going around in circles just as birds of prey do,

112
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,190
because a thermal's a rising column of air
and in order to stay in it you have to turn.

113
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,478
There's nothing to see though, is there?
Apart from what's on the ground.

114
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,478
You can't see anything in the air
to indicate a thermal

115
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,797
Right now there's no
cumulus cloud over this thermal

116
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,913
But often there is. If you look over there,
you can see all those cumulus clouds.

117
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,429
Underneath most of those
there would be a thermal,

118
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,633
and that's one of those indicators of lift,
that's one thing we look for,

119
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,197
and that's what birds look for also
when they fly, I'm sure.

120
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,430
Feel that! Now there's
a big rocky outcropping. Just look at that.

121
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,599
Now you can see the altimeter winding up.
Look at that.

122
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,956
- How high could we go with this?
- Probably up to 14-15,000 feet with no
problem.

123
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,712
- And do the birds go as high as that?
- I've seen birds up to 16-18,000 feet.

124
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,515
- They are just out there flying for fun.
- How do you know that?

125
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,113
Because how can you see
a mouse from 18,000 feet? Not hardly.

126
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,111
And they do all kinds of tricks and aerobatics.
Look at this. We're really going up now.

127
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,757
The pressure on the wings
is actually bending them, isn't it?

128
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,190
The spar is slightly flexible,

129
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,076
so when you develop more lift,
the spar actually bends upwards a little bit.

130
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,916
Very similar to a bird.

131
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,793
Every flight has to end in a landing.

132
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,028
That requires less energy,
but perhaps more skill if disaster is to be avoided,

133
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,630
particularly if you are a big bird like a pelican.

134
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,558
A swan, one of the heaviest of flying birds,

135
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:08,359
can only come down on the smoothest
and most forgiving of natural surfaces; water.

136
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,518
There you can use your feet as brakes.

137
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,519
Albatross are not so lucky.
They have to alight on the ground.

138
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,874
Indeed their landings seem scarcely better
than controlled accidents.

139
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,474
Most birds, however, have to come down
with much greater precision than that.

140
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,958
They may have to land, after all,
on a narrow ledge or a very thin branch.

141
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,438
To do that they have to lower their flaps,
put down the undercarriage

142
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,191
and put on their brakes so that they
lose all air speed at the precise moment

143
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:08,509
that they come alongside their perch.
That requires great judgement and co-ordination.

144
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,875
A Griffin vulture is
able to exploit the position of its nest,

145
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,470
which is nearly always on the ledge of a cliff.

146
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,790
It descends towards it at speed.

147
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,235
It aims for a point below its nest
and then brakes by swooping upwards

148
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,275
so that as it arrives at its ledge
its forward speed is zero.

149
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,670
Landing into the wind helps any bird
by keeping air flowing over the wings

150
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,077
and maintaining lift until the last moment.

151
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,873
So, one way or another, birds manage to
complete an operation fraught with danger,

152
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,275
with virtually total success.

153
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,472
As anyone who has had to pay for
excess baggage at an airport knows,

154
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,719
if you travel by air, it is important
to keep your weight down.

155
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,948
This magnificent golden eagle manages
to do that in a most thoroughgoing way.

156
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,871
It's about the same size, I suppose, as a bulldog.
But I couldn't hold a bulldog on my wrist.

157
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,231
But this bird
only weights about a quarter as much.

158
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,797
So how do birds manage to keep so light?

159
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,791
A beak is not so weighty as the bony jaws
and teeth of a mammal like a bulldog

160
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,560
or one of the birds' reptilian ancestors.

161
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:42,599
Its disadvantage is that a bird can't chew.
It can pluck, crush or, like an eagle, tear and rip.

162
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,310
They also have weight-saving features
inside their bodies,

163
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,229
a skeleton with fewer bones
than a mammal's, no tail-bone,

164
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,276
one wing-bone instead of five fingers,
and a slim pelvis fused to the backbone.

165
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,549
And the bones themselves are not solid
like a mammal's, but hollow.

166
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,276
Inside they have a lattice of cross-struts
so they are nonetheless very strong.

167
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,836
But the most remarkable
weight-saving features of all

168
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,033
are those things that only birds possess:
their feathers.

169
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,836
They look simple, but in fact
they have a very complex structure.

170
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,989
The quills are hollow and very light,
yet resilient and extremely strong.

171
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,431
The filaments on either side of the quills
are fringed with microscopic hooks

172
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,476
that link them to their neighbours so that they
all latch together to form a continuous surface.

173
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,071
And that means that if a feather
gets damaged or over-strained,

174
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,637
it can be repaired instantly. It can be zipped up.

175
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,395
Not surprisingly, all birds lavish
a great deal of attention on their feathers.

176
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,833
After all, their lives depend on them.
And since birds have no hands,

177
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,158
they have little alternative
but to care for them with their beaks.

178
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,518
But one bird, uniquely, can't do that.

179
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,030
The sword-billed hummingbird
has a beak that is so long

180
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,518
that there is no way
that its tip can touch its feathers.

181
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,750
It has to comb its plumage with one foot
while balancing on its perch with the other.

182
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,916
Not easy!

183
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:04,632
A good bath is also important in keeping
the feathers clean and in first-class condition.

184
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,594
Most birds take one every day
and, watching them doing so,

185
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:15,672
it's difficult to avoid coming to the conclusion
that they enjoy it just as much as we do.

186
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,833
Not all birds, of course, can get to water
that is deep enough for bathing.

187
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,555
Then, like the quail that lives on dry plains

188
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:28,279
and during the summer seldom finds
so much as a puddle, they may have to use dust.

189
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,030
This may not exactly make them cleaner, but
it does, apparently, help in dislodging parasites

190
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,598
such as lice that nibble their feathers,
mites that scavenge bits of dead skin

191
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,633
and ticks that suck their blood.

192
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,714
Many parrots and cockatoos grow special feathers
that fray at the end into a fine powder.

193
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,639
These feathers are
scattered throughout the plumage,

194
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,038
and as a bird such as a cockatoo
scratches itself at the end of its toilet,

195
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,951
the powder is dislodged in clouds
and is caught in its ruffled feathers.

196
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,592
Exactly how this powder
improves the feathers is not really certain,

197
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:36,750
but it is probable that it helps with waterproofing
as well as by discouraging parasites.

198
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,950
Parasites, in fact, are such a problem

199
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:55,235
that some birds are thought to
recruit assistants to help in getting rid of them.

200
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,396
Ants!

201
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,309
Crows and jays deliberately land on an ant's nest

202
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:11,868
and stir up the colony so that the angry insects
come rushing out and swarm all over them.

203
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:19,191
In their irritation the ants discharge formic acid
which is a particularly powerful insecticide.

204
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,551
But we don't really understand this behaviour.

205
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,197
It may be that the birds are stimulating the ants
to get rid of their formic acid

206
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,870
so that they are more digestible as meals.

207
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:47,072
Regular, meticulous maintenance is essential
for maximum efficiency and safety in the air,

208
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,238
and that applies to everything that flies.

209
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,034
Well, that was about 500 miles an hour
and of course birds can't equal that.

210
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:39,316
But nonetheless, before aeroplanes were invented,
a bird was the fastest living thing in the air.

211
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,108
The peregrine holds the record.

212
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,835
Diving on its prey
it can exceed 200 miles an hour.

213
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,397
It achieves maximum aerodynamic efficiency

214
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,913
by sweeping back its wings, like the jet fighter.
Then it accelerates by beating them.

215
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,077
The barn owl, on the other hand,

216
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:39,149
owes its success as a hunter
to its ability to fly extremely slowly.

217
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,829
It hunts voles and mice
and, to find them in the grass

218
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,999
it has to search very intently, and that takes time.

219
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,039
Its wings therefore
are shaped very differently from a peregrine's.

220
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,951
They are rounded in outline and much broader
which gives the maximum lift at slow speeds.

221
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:06,712
But the barn owl also has
a very special adaptation for this kind of hunting.

222
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:14,676
The rodents it seeks are often invisible
from the air, hidden beneath the matted grass.

223
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,873
The barn owl detects them
by the rustling sounds they make.

224
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,231
To do that, it has extremely acute hearing,

225
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:28,276
the sounds being focused by the hair-like
feathers of the discs on either side of its head.

226
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,917
But if it is to hear them
it has to fly very quietly indeed,

227
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:39,036
and its wings are fitted with silencers.
Fluffy margins to its wing feathers.

228
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:48,078
So, in the evenings, a barn owl can
waft over the countryside as silent as a moth.

229
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:28,199
This little dot, suspended in the sky,
might seem to be the slowest flyer of all.

230
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,712
It's a kestrel It's not, in fact, truly stationary.

231
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:38,233
It's facing into a gentle wind,
so there is a current of air passing over its wings.

232
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,397
And that gives it all the lift it requires.

233
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:49,472
Silence is not as important for the kestrel
as it is for the barn owl, for it hunts by sight.

234
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,877
The wind has dropped a little.
Now, to keep its position relative to the ground

235
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,834
it has to flap
to keep the air moving over its wings.

236
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,310
It's spotted something,
a quick turn into the wind, and a drop;

237
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,398
a turn back to face
the wind for a stationary check;

238
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,556
another quick look;

239
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,079
but whatever it was, has gone.

240
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,911
0nly one group of birds
can manage to hover for any length of time

241
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,159
without the help of a head-wind:
the hummingbirds.

242
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,117
Their wings work in a way
quite unlike that used by any other birds.

243
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,551
They beat routinely 25 times a second,

244
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,992
so fast that they make the humming noise
that gives them their name.

245
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,797
It is impossible to see how they operate
unless the camera slows them down.

246
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,438
The wings have become, in effect,
twirling blades that create down-draughts,

247
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:32,316
rather like those that man produces
with his hovering machines.

248
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,593
Helicopters, however, have a very special device,

249
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,759
a wheel revolving continuously on an axle.

250
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:57,910
No bird or any other animal has yet evolved
a mechanism that can exactly parallel this.

251
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,871
But hummingbirds have the next best thing:

252
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,756
wings which beat in a figure of eight
and flick over on the backstroke.

253
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,714
Unlike the wings of other birds,
they are symmetrical in cross-section

254
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,913
and work equally well
with either surface uppermost.

255
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,310
By changing the angle of the beat,
the thrust can be directed not only downwards,

256
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,636
but either forwards or backwards.

257
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:35,518
So a hummingbird, steering with its tail,
can move through the air in any direction.

258
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,515
Beating wings at such speed, however,
uses a lot of fuel

259
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,157
Even at rest, hummers need a great deal
just to keep their bodies ticking over.

260
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,828
So they have to refuel very frequently.

261
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:55,398
But their fuel stations, flowers, close at night.
What do they do then?

262
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,393
This is a particular problem in the Andes,
where the nights can be very cold indeed.

263
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,637
As evening comes on, the hillstar hummingbird

264
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,789
makes its way to
its regular roosting place, in a cave.

265
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,996
After its regular toilet,
it settles down for the night,

266
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,636
and in effect turns off all its motors.

267
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,593
Its heart, that in flight
contracted a thousand times a minute,

268
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,554
slows until its beat is virtually undetectable.

269
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,873
Its body temperature falls dramatically
and its breathing seems to cease altogether.

270
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,709
It is doing what a hedgehog does in winter,
it is hibernating.

271
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,994
But for a hummingbird,
winter comes 365 times a year.

272
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,112
The sun returns,
and the temperature begins to rise.

273
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,798
The hillstar starts up its motors.

274
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,279
Its heart beat accelerates,
its muscles slowly warm to flying temperature.

275
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,873
A quick pre-flight check.

276
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,557
And it's off again.

277
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,112
At higher altitudes,
it seldom gets really warm even at midday.

278
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,312
This is the territory of the giant hummingbird.

279
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,590
It's as big as a thrush.

280
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:50,954
Great size helps in retaining body heat,
but this is as big as a hummingbird can get.

281
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:56,712
Any larger and it couldn't beat its wings
fast enough for this kind of flight.

282
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,475
And this is one of the smallest of all birds,

283
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:09,596
the purple-collared woodstar from Ecuador
with a wingspan of scarcely more than two inches.

284
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,791
Small wings are easier to flap,

285
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,358
but the smaller they are, the faster they have
to move to produce sufficient downwards thrust,

286
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,680
and this hummingbird can beat its wings
at an astonishing 75 times a second.

287
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,713
It is barely bigger than a moth.

288
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,239
Indeed this moth looks so like a tiny hummingbird

289
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,353
that some people in the south of England,
where it appears regularly in the summer,

290
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,314
think that they have been visited
by a real hummer.

291
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,517
The ability to fly
gave birds the freedom of the planet.

292
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,793
Rivers, deserts, seas, even mountain ranges

293
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,233
are no obstacle to them as they are
to land-bound creatures such as ourselves.

294
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,629
They can fly relatively easily and quickly
to collect a sudden glut of food.

295
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,231
And that is exactly what has happened here.
I'm in northern Canada.

296
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,069
It's June,
the beginning of the short Arctic summer.

297
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,592
The rising temperatures have caused
the plants to put out new leaves and roots,

298
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,794
and tens of thousands of snow geese
have come here to graze.

299
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,118
They nested almost as soon as they arrived
and many have already got families.

300
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,674
Even hummingbirds have come up to the far north

301
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:16,830
to collect nectar from the bushes that are now
briefly blooming within sight of glaciers.

302
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:33,153
0n the Arctic coasts,
little waders, western sandpipers,

303
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,559
are collecting a rich harvest of small worms
that are swarming in the mud.

304
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,311
In the middle of the continent, on the prairies,

305
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,798
sorghum and other grain crops are
ripening in the summer sun.

306
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,594
Dickcissels, relatives of the common sparrow,

307
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,758
have come up here to take their percentage.

308
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,235
The warm weather
has caused swarms of insects to hatch

309
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,716
and they provide the dickcissels
with the protein that is essential

310
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,196
for the nourishment
of their swiftly growing young.

311
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,479
Hawks are also breeding here in the north.

312
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,753
They were attracted by the seasonal abundance
of voles and other small mammals,

313
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,909
as well as the finches and songbirds
that they need to feed their young.

314
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,392
But the superabundance of summer is brief.

315
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,954
By the end of July
the days are noticeably shortening.

316
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,470
Many of the trees
are preparing to shed their leaves.

317
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,835
The birds that flew up for the summer banquet
can no longer stay.

318
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,557
All across the northern hemisphere
the story is the same.

319
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,718
From eastern Siberia across Asia and Europe,

320
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:42,517
to the woodlands and tundra of north America,
birds are starting to fly south.

321
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:54,110
The sandpipers are stocking up for
the 6,000 mile journey that lies ahead of them.

322
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,915
They eat so voraciously
that they will nearly double their weight,

323
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,795
putting on layers of fat
on their upper thighs and their flanks.

324
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,230
They even shrink their internal organs,

325
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,750
partially absorbing them
as though they were food reserves

326
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,157
and replacing them
with more readily available fat.

327
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,789
They must wait for the right weather conditions,

328
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,279
and then, when the wind
blows strongly from the north, they set off.

329
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:52,350
Hawks and vultures are also now
finding it harder to discover any food.

330
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,074
They too must prepare to leave.

331
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,556
But the weather they require for their journeys
is rather different.

332
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,072
They need a good hot day when the thermals
are shimmering upwards from the rocks

333
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,317
that are still warming in the late summer sun.

334
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:16,310
As the last thermals of summer start to rise,
the birds circle up to great heights,

335
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:22,959
10,000 feet or more, to give themselves
a good start for the long journey ahead.

336
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:28,154
As they glide southwards, slowly losing height,
they will look for another thermal

337
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:34,879
and make for its base so that once again
they will be lifted high enough to reach the next.

338
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,033
The snow geese are already on their way,

339
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,392
their departure triggered by the shortening days
and the dropping temperatures.

340
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,639
They will rely on straightforward muscle power.

341
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:01,915
They will travel continuously for great lengths
of time, both through the day and the night.

342
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,398
The raptors, however,
have had to stop to overnight in a roost.

343
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,433
Without thermals they can't travel far.

344
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,475
But the snow geese fly on.

345
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:51,435
The exertion of continuously beating their wings
creates a lot of heat in their bodies,

346
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,633
so travelling in the cool of the night
does, in fact, suit them.

347
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,436
They navigate by the stars.

348
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:06,398
If the skies are heavily overcast for long periods
they may lose their way, but that is exceptional

349
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,394
Day returns and the stars fade.
Now they steer by the sun.

350
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,149
But the sun, of course,
moves from east to west during the day,

351
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,954
so the fact that they are able
to use it for navigation

352
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:26,996
means that they must have internal clocks
and know fairly exactly what the time is.

353
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:33,672
Members of the same family travel together,
calling to one another as they go.

354
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,195
And the geese have made it.

355
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:31,353
One of them has been recorded as covering
an astonishing 1,700 miles in a mere 70 hours.

356
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:38,557
These fields in California will be their home
until they return north on their spring migration.

357
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,878
The sandpipers have gone even further.
They have now reached Mexico.

358
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:07,150
But they will spend only a few days here
for this is merely a refuelling stop.

359
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,319
They feed intensively, replacing
the fat reserves that they have lost.

360
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,357
The raptors, so conscious of
the nature of the land beneath them

361
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:29,908
that generates thermals on which they depend,
also look to it for their signposts.

362
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:36,116
They are now passing Mexico's highest mountain,
the Pico de 0rizaba.

363
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,516
There are no thermals to be found over the sea,
so they are tied to the land,

364
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:58,317
and that means they have to go all the way round
the western side of the Gulf of Mexico.

365
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:03,310
There is, of course, a short cut,
directly south across the sea.

366
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:09,152
Astonishingly, the little ruby-throat hummingbird
tackles that 500 mile long journey.

367
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:15,435
It must necessarily be non-stop
for a hummingbird cannot land on the water.

368
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,840
A feeder in Texas provides a ruby-throat
with a final top-up of nectar.

369
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,509
Its cruising speed is about 27 miles an hour.

370
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:37,239
So, if conditions are good, it could make
the crossing by flying for a little over 18 hours.

371
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,750
But that is right on the very limit of its endurance.

372
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,750
If even a light head-wind
springs up it will perish at sea.

373
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:57,710
Delphiniums blooming on the Mexican shore
await with life-saving nectar.

374
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,911
A ruby-throat arrives after its epic journey

375
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:11,877
and feeds urgently before it runs out of fuel,
and it's fatally grounded.

376
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,591
But even now its journey is not finished.

377
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,477
It still has several hundred miles to go
and may travel as far as the Panama border.

378
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,479
The hawks and vultures,
travelling round the western side of the Gulf,

379
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,830
have now reached Panama City.

380
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,875
They came from all over North America,
converged on the Isthmus

381
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,470
and travelled together
down that narrow corridor of land

382
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,993
so that now, for the only time each year,
they form dense flocks.

383
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,111
Below, on the mud of Panama Bay,
the sandpipers are feeding.

384
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,278
This, at last, is the end of their journey.

385
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,631
The mud here will never freeze,
the sea will enrich it daily,

386
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:20,277
and each bird returns every year
to exactly the same patch.

387
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,832
The raptors rise
once more in an immense vortex.

388
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,272
From here they will take
their separate ways all over South America,

389
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,393
some going as far south as Argentina.

390
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:40,833
0nly by dispersing widely
will each bird find enough prey to sustain itself.

391
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,635
The dickcissels have also travelled
down the Isthmus of Panama.

392
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,434
They too have come from all over North America

393
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:55,351
and have been funnelled together
into flocks of gigantic size and density.

394
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:07,198
This surely is the very acme of flying skill.

395
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,234
How they co-ordinate their flight
in these extraordinary concentrations,

396
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,796
changing direction within it, as if with one mind,

397
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,834
is one of the unsolved mysteries of ornithology.

398
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,709
Years ago, they, like the hawks and eagles,
would have travelled on south from here

399
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,753
and spread over
the plains of northern South America

400
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,032
to feed on the seeds of wild grasses.

401
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:43,917
But here in Venezuela,
they find great fields of cultivated grain,

402
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,680
exactly like they found up in the north.

403
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,475
So they have no need to disperse,
but remain together

404
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,036
and devastate the crops wherever they settle.

405
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,833
It seems they positively
prefer one another's company.

406
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,952
Some of the flocks may be half a million strong.

407
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:23,792
And man's practice of intensive cultivation
allows them to stay and feed together.

408
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,677
At night they select a relatively small patch
within a huge field of sugar cane

409
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,034
where the whole half million roost,
half a dozen birds to a single stem.

410
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,749
Flying, when all is said and done,
takes a great deal of energy.

411
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,238
So birds have huge appetites
and have to spend much of their lives

412
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:09,152
in an unending search for food
to fuel their expensive lifestyle.

413
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:15,913
Just how they find it, we will be looking at
in the next programme in The Life of Birds.
