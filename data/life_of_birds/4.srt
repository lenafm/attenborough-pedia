2
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,679
Sparrows in South Africa.

3
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,474
Like all sparrows,
they eat pretty well anything;

4
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,195
insects, fruit and particularly seeds.

5
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,509
They convert that diet into their own flesh,
which is the richest of all foods: meat.

6
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,678
So they themselves are much hunted.

7
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,910
A falcon is also looking for a meal

8
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,830
And it has one.

9
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:58,279
Meat is such a rich food that a falcon need
only kill once a day to sustain itself.

10
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,029
So there's plenty of time
for sitting around on the perch.

11
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,918
Nice work if you can get it. But getting it
is not necessarily all that easy.

12
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,715
This hillside in New Zealand may look bare,

13
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,234
but in fact I'm sitting in the middle of
an immense, active colony of shearwaters.

14
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,117
The adults at the moment are out at sea
fishing, but these are their burrows

15
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,111
and inside of almost every one,
there is a fat, juicy chick.

16
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,993
And this bird knows it.

17
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,957
This is a parrot, a kea,

18
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,358
but not the sort of parrot that
is content just with fruit and nuts.

19
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,079
Its beak can certainly cope with such things,
but it can also give a bite that kills.

20
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,591
The keas tour the shearwaters' burrows, listening.

21
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,677
They've heard something.

22
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,759
A shearwater chick is moving
in its underground nest chamber.

23
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,633
But the tunnel is too narrow for them.

24
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,919
If they want the chick,
they will have to dig for it.

25
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,111
Keas became meat-eaters relatively recently

26
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,279
and have no special adaptations
to help them find their victims.

27
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,597
But other birds took to eating meat much earlier

28
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,112
and they have some highly sophisticated ways
of locating their targets.

29
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,792
The great grey owl hunts in the Arctic.
In the summer, it scarcely gets dark,

30
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,279
but the owl's prey is, in any case, largely invisible
for it is hidden beneath the snow.

31
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,353
Like the kea, the owl listens for its victims.

32
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:46,079
Its hearing is many times more sensitive than
the kea's, and ten times better than ours.

33
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,750
The feathered discs on either side of its face
act like ear-trumpets.

34
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,873
Each shields the ear on one side
from sound coming from the other.

35
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,755
So the owl can scan the landscape in stereo.

36
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,432
It's detected a faint rustle beneath the snow,
made by a lemming.

37
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,713
Invisibility was insufficient protection
for the lemming.

38
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,679
The great grey owl's hearing
enables it to hunt the year round,

39
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,839
even through the Arctic winter,
when it's dark for weeks on end.

40
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,319
Elsewhere, other owls locate their prey
with a different sense: vision.

41
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,872
The bigger an eye, the more light it gathers,
so the better it functions at very low light levels.

42
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,868
These eyes are so big that they
can't even revolve in their sockets.

43
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,514
They belong to a scops owl

44
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,309
They are sensitive to shape rather than colour,

45
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,115
so a scops owl sees
a soot and whitewash world,

46
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,235
but a world that most other birds
would find impenetrably dark.

47
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,196
Without colour, it's movement
that betrays the presence of prey.

48
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:07,915
A spider. Quite big enough and succulent
enough to provide a snack for a scops.

49
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,749
And that is what it will be if it moves.

50
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,758
Daytime hunters, like these buzzards,
have vision of a different kind.

51
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,632
During the breeding season,
they feed mainly on young rabbits.

52
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,953
If there is plenty of light, an eye
can become virtually a telescope

53
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,676
and buzzards can spot a rabbit
from over a mile away if it moves.

54
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,789
They also see it in full colour.

55
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,750
With such acute distant vision,

56
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,956
a buzzard can keep a great area under constant
surveillance without moving from its perch.

57
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,432
Rabbits feeding beside their warren. They would
be unwise to venture far from their holes.

58
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,875
The buzzard has detected a chance
and is in the air.

59
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,233
From 300 feet above the ground,
it can see each rabbit very clearly.

60
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,992
No luck this time for the buzzard.

61
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,991
The great majority of a buzzard's attacks
are failures

62
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,469
but the energy spent on an attempt such as this
was not great and the wind carries it back aloft.

63
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,193
The kestrel, little more than
half the size of the buzzard.

64
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,994
It seeks much smaller prey: voles.

65
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,510
Its colour vision is also excellent,
better, indeed, than ours

66
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,475
for it spans a greater range of the spectrum
extending into the ultraviolet.

67
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,148
So the blue of the sea around the Cornish coast

68
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,273
appears much more intense to a kestrel
than it does to us.

69
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,715
For a long time, no one could understand how,
or indeed if, that might help it to hunt.

70
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,957
Now we're beginning to get clues.

71
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,839
The voles seldom leave the shelter of their tunnels
through the grass, at least during the day.

72
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,192
They repeatedly mark their tracks with urine,

73
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,234
and urine, in ultraviolet light,
is very conspicuous.

74
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,709
So with ultraviolet vision,

75
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,516
the kestrel can see the signposts
that the voles can only smell.

76
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,431
As a consequence, the kestrel knows
just where to focus its attention.

77
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,755
And that was a success.

78
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,991
The open skies above the wide plains of Africa.

79
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,997
Vultures. They also eat meat, but only that
which has been slaughtered by others.

80
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,238
They, too, rely on keen eyesight
to find their meals.

81
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,711
Their eyes are so acute they can keep watch over
the plains from more than 1,000 feet up.

82
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,958
The warm columns of air rising from the baking
ground and captured by their broad wings

83
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:28,679
carries them up with very little expenditure of
energy on their part and supports them there.

84
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,872
They scan the ground beneath them, but
they also keep a sharp eye on one another.

85
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,153
A lappet-faced vulture is on the ground
beside a carcass.

86
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,638
Griffon vultures have noticed it
and have started to wheel downwards.

87
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,154
0thers have already joined
the lappet-faced around the kill.

88
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,195
As more birds glide down, their descent
is noticed from miles away in all directions.

89
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,118
And as each bird reacts,

90
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,952
the news that a kill has been discovered spreads
across the network of watchers in the sky.

91
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,349
More and more start circling downwards
towards the banquet.

92
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,751
Within a few minutes, the carcass is submerged
beneath a dense scrum of struggling birds.

93
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,276
Lacking feathers on their heads and necks,

94
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,713
they do not unduly soil themselves as they
plunge their heads deep into the carcass.

95
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,113
And still more come.

96
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,956
The big cats may make most of the kills
on the Serengeti,

97
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,675
but most of the meat produced on the plains
is consumed,

98
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,316
not by lions and leopards, but by vultures.

99
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:34,239
To human nostrils, the stench of corruption here
is overwhelming.

100
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,638
But these vultures are impervious to it.
They can't sense it.

101
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,116
It was the sharpness of their vision
that brought them here.

102
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,308
But there's one bird that, exceptionally,

103
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,593
has en extremely acute sense of smell.

104
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,117
Here in the rainforest of Trinidad there's
an almost unbroken ceiling of leaves above me.

105
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:10,476
No bird flying in the sky above could see
a piece of meat like this lying on the forest floor.

106
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,229
But this is an extremely smelly piece of meat.

107
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,268
Let me hide it.

108
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,553
I can keep watch from a hill
that rises above the canopy.

109
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,875
Not a bird in sight.

110
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,758
But there's one, a turkey vulture...and another.

111
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,998
You can tell it's a turkey vulture,
because its naked head is not black but red.

112
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,159
And it's always the turkey vultures
that are on the scene first.

113
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,754
The meat I put down is directly under there.

114
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,517
And already, it's less than three-quarters of
an hour ago, they're beginning to assemble.

115
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,110
It seems almost unbelievable that
the smell from that small piece of meat

116
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,788
could have drifted up through the forest canopy

117
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,755
and so permeate the air that
it can be detected half a mile away.

118
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,439
It's equally astonishing that the birds are able to
measure its relative strength with such accuracy

119
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,995
that they can trace it back to its source

120
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,479
simply by sensing in which direction
it becomes marginally stronger.

121
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,878
But a turkey vulture is exceptionally
well-equipped among birds;

122
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,234
with wide-open nostrils and extremely
well-developed sense organs within them.

123
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,679
It's getting close. There's something
in there somewhere.

124
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,558
Got it!

125
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,836
Their beaks are quite adequate
for tearing off strips of flesh,

126
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,716
and vultures, after all, do not kill
the animals that they eat.

127
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,311
But those that do have to have
much more powerful weapons.

128
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,311
Few animals can survive
the grasp of these massive talons.

129
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,956
They belong to the African crowned eagle.

130
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:46,793
This bird is huge, over three feet long, and it can
kill prey over four times its own weight.

131
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:54,075
It hunts over the canopy of the East African forest
and seeks particularly monkeys.

132
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,954
Vervet monkeys seldom expose themselves
by venturing into the very highest branches,

133
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,674
so hunting them is not easy.

134
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,759
The eagle has relatively short wings
for its great size,

135
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,918
which helps if it has to plunge
through the canopy.

136
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,919
The vervets have a special call that warns
the whole troop that danger threatens from above.

137
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,117
It's caught a monkey.

138
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,350
Its mate joins it, and together
they return to their nest.

139
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,716
The chick is only a few days old, too young
to tear apart the prey for itself.

140
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,073
It has a lot of growing to do
and a huge appetite.

141
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,876
The adults will have to feed it for four months
before it is ready to fly from the nest,

142
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,756
and nine months after that before
it is strong enough to hunt for itself.

143
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,713
To keep themselves and their young properly fed,

144
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,198
a pair of crowned eagles need
a large hunting ground all to themselves.

145
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,473
So all eagles defend their territories
with great vigour.

146
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,236
This one, a sea eagle, is patrolling
a forest-covered coast in Malaysia

147
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,954
along which it fishes every day.

148
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,232
Those that live in the air have to fight in the air.

149
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,592
And eagles do so with their primary weapons:
their talons.

150
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:47,438
Lake Bogoria in the African rift valley,
a soda lake fed by hot volcanic springs.

151
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:55,713
At first sight, a ferociously inhospitable place,
and indeed it is, for most creatures.

152
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,595
But although no fish can live
in its tepid soda-laden waters,

153
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,759
it's nonetheless packed with food for fish eagles.

154
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,795
A million flamingos.

155
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,198
The food chain that sustains a meat-eater
could scarcely be shorter than it is here.

156
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,394
Microscopic plants, algae, that can uniquely
tolerate these salty waters

157
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,239
proliferate in the sunshine by the ton.

158
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,671
Flamingos filter the algae from the water
with their beaks,

159
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,394
and vegetable is turned into flesh.

160
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,512
And that flesh is food for eagles.

161
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,315
The flamingos have to go into the shallows

162
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,433
to drink from the spring that provides
the only fresh water in the lake.

163
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,393
But here they are very vulnerable.

164
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,196
As the eagle approaches, the flamingos
stampede into deeper water.

165
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,958
The eagle won't tackle them there

166
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,995
because it has difficulty in lifting anything
much bigger than a fish and carrying it away.

167
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,273
So it can only eat a flamingo
in the shallows or on the shore.

168
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,672
This concentration of prey is so dense

169
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,190
that pairs of fish eagles have been able to
establish themselves

170
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,756
every mile or so around the margins of the lake.

171
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,671
But even this number of hunters has little effect
on the size of the flamingo population.

172
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,958
Fish eagles normally snatch fish
from the surface of the water,

173
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:21,359
they don't usually tackle a bird on the wing,
but there is no need to do so here.

174
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,236
Now it has to drag its victim to the shore.

175
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:14,349
Few hunters can have a greater concentration
of prey continuously at their disposal

176
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,233
The flamingos are back in the shallows.

177
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,194
It would be difficult to imagine
a more barren hunting territory

178
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,915
than this lava field in the volcanic islands
of the Galapagos.

179
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,556
But there's a bird that finds its prey even here.

180
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:48,520
Although there is little vegetation on land, there
is quite a lot in the waters around the coast.

181
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,429
And these bizarre lizards,
marine iguanas, graze on it.

182
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:59,113
They can even swim to the sea-floor to do so.
There they are unreachable by hunting birds.

183
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,789
But they come out of the sea on to the rocks
to rest and to warm up.

184
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,879
The big ones are too big and strong for a hawk.

185
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,551
The small ones can scuttle away
and get safety in one of the cracks.

186
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,356
But the females, particularly at
one time of the year, are vulnerable.

187
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,109
The Galapagos hawks know exactly when that is.
It's the breeding season,

188
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,838
when the female iguanas must venture out
on to the few sandy beaches to lay their eggs.

189
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,952
Here they can dig the holes they need.

190
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,192
Hawks all over the island keep watch
beside the few beaches.

191
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,475
By the time the iguana has finished
digging and laying, she must be tired,

192
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,114
so the hawk then has its best chance.

193
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,836
But even so, iguanas can run very fast indeed.

194
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,557
If the iguana can reach the rocks, she'll be safe.

195
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,312
This one retreats into the burrow
she's only just dug.

196
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,035
She'll have to try and make her escape later.

197
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,873
The outcome is by no means certain.
The iguana is still extremely strong.

198
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,157
But not strong enough.

199
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,309
A number of hawks take advantage of this bounty.

200
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,592
Wounded though it is, this one can still run.

201
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,394
The hawk has lost this encounter.

202
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,717
It can't catch an iguana
once it has reached its burrow,

203
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,559
even though it might still be able to see it.

204
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,110
But some hawks are especially equipped
for snatching their prey from deep within holes.

205
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,678
This is the African harrier hawk.

206
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,472
Its legs are particularly long.

207
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,876
Even more crucially, they are double-jointed,
so they can bend backwards,

208
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,958
invaluable when groping in
the depths of a nest hole

209
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:35,278
trying to extract a chick,
as this young bird is doing.

210
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,513
No luck.

211
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,190
But the adult, seeking lizards in the rocks,
is more persistent.

212
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,150
It swallows its lizard whole.

213
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,478
This lizard, however, has been caught by a shrike,

214
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,355
a much smaller bird and too small
to swallow such prey,

215
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,078
but neither its beak nor its claws are powerful
enough to tear its victim's body apart.

216
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,952
The acacias of Africa provide
all the hooks and spikes

217
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,993
that such a bird could need for butchery.

218
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,315
Prey as small as beetles and as big as stoats
are treated this way.

219
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,672
Some of the larger animals are left
on their skewers, like hung game,

220
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,269
so that decay loosens their flesh.

221
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,952
Stocks are sometimes built up in these larders
to last a shrike through hard times.

222
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,199
But often the temptation of fresh meat
is irresistible.

223
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,873
The lammergeier actually eats bones,

224
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:47,198
but breaking up a large skeleton
is an even bigger problem.

225
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,879
A lammergeier, hefty though it is, has not got
the beak or claws to do that job.

226
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,277
But like a shrike, it knows a trick or two.

227
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,309
It doesn't just drop a bone anywhere.

228
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,034
It has its favourite patches of bare rock,

229
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,391
though sometimes its aim
is not as good as it might be.

230
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,797
It's getting a few splinters off this bone.
It can swallow even the sharpest fragment,

231
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,438
for its digestive juices are so powerfully acid
that bone dissolves very rapidly.

232
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,757
The greatest prize is the marrow and to get that,

233
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:21,114
the big bones have to be well and truly split
and that takes perseverance.

234
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,596
A lammergeier may have to drop a bone
up to 50 times

235
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,475
before it hits rock at just the right angle
to split it.

236
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:43,556
The bodies of other animals provide such rich food
that a bird doesn't need to eat a lot of it.

237
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,709
But getting it nonetheless demands not only skill
but often a great deal of effort.

238
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,959
An English wood is full of such food, but
the dense cover makes things difficult.

239
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,469
But there is one bird that
specialises in hunting here.

240
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:09,597
It flies very fast, very low
and takes its victims by surprise.

241
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,754
This is one of its favourite hunting places;

242
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,191
an old overgrown orchard
where lots of woodland birds

243
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,155
come to feed on rotting apples
and the grubs they attract.

244
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,311
A sparrowhawk visits the wood every day,
and waits for just the right moment.

245
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,790
It knows every twist and turn
in its approach flight.

246
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,073
It has flown it often enough before,
sometimes two or three times a day.

247
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:18,114
Its short rounded wings and long tail enable it
to fly at speed through really narrow gaps.

248
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,313
Warning calls alert the whole woodland.

249
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,556
This time it wasn't quick enough to catch
the bird community by surprise.

250
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,029
This hunter is six times heavier
than a sparrowhawk.

251
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,950
It's a goshawk and it hunts not only birds
but mammals.

252
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,069
A brown rat.

253
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,915
The goshawk too can manoeuvre
through the narrow gaps,

254
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,795
but it also has another way of hunting
in the woodlands.

255
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,392
It will pursue the rat on foot.

256
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,749
Even though hunters have
a formidable armoury and great skill,

257
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,919
most of their hunting trips, like this one,
end in failure.

258
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:33,833
The coast of Cornwall, the territory of one of
the most highly specialised of all hunting birds.

259
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,151
These are one of its favourite prey, pigeons.

260
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:45,319
High in the sky, so high it's almost invisible,
a peregrine is watching.

261
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,110
Pigeons fly fast.

262
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,989
The peregrine starts its attack.

263
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,155
Wings drawn back, it's travelling
at 200 miles an hour.

264
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,716
Striking its victim with its talons at this speed
brings instant death.

265
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,233
The peregrine returns to its nest.

266
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,876
It has two eager customers for the meat.

267
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:12,189
An adult peregrine must kill several times a day
if its chicks are to be kept adequately fed.

268
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,997
Five weeks must pass before the chicks are
fully fledged and ready for their first flight.

269
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:38,870
They start with somewhat experimental outings,
getting used to the feel of the air in their wings.

270
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,149
Another youngster watches.

271
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:55,198
Ten days later the young birds are confident
enough to tease a passing seagull.

272
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:13,112
The high-speed aerial pounce, the peregrine's
speciality,  takes a lot of learning.

273
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:25,155
You have to be able, in mid-air, to throw
your legs forwards with talons outstretched.

274
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,670
Your sibling's tail makes a good practice target.

275
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,230
Now three youngsters join together in the game.

276
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,673
They perfect the manoeuvre
that launches the dive,

277
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:52,000
the roll and the pumping of the wings with which
the peregrine generates its unique speed.

278
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,593
Tumbling and rolling, diving and striking.
It may seem like innocent play,

279
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,669
but like so much play, it's practice
for the serious business of adult life.

280
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,477
And now a lesson for advanced students only.

281
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:34,118
An adult joining the youngsters carrying in
its talons a pigeon, wounded but still alive.

282
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,589
And the youngster takes it
to make its very first kill.

283
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:46,549
In a month it will become
the swiftest of all the world's hunters.

284
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:52,593
But only about a third of the earth
is covered by land.

285
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,874
The rest is covered by water, of one kind
or another. There's plenty of food there, too,

286
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,834
but you have to learn very different techniques
if you're going to go fishing,

287
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,635
as we will see in the next programme
in The Life 0f Birds.
