
2
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,717
It's spring in Sweden.

3
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,115
Fieldfares are industriously ferrying
meals of worms to their ravenous chicks.

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,950
They nest in colonies, up to thirty or forty
in a group, and that helps a lot with defence,

5
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,550
which is important,
for there are plenty of raiders around.

6
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,791
That was one.

7
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,917
It's a young raven. He's after a nestling.

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,596
A fieldfare has spotted him and sounds the alarm.

9
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,195
0thers take up the call,
and the defence force assembles.

10
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,909
The raven now knows that he's been spotted,
but he's hungry.

11
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,271
The fieldfares, screaming with anger,
converge on their enemy.

12
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,235
And now threat turns into direct action.
They mob him.

13
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,239
Thoroughly intimidated by the commotion,
the raven retreats.

14
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,556
But the fighters press home their attack,
and the raven is brought down.

15
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,718
And now they bomb him with their droppings.

16
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,233
Soiled feathers soon become waterlogged,
and that could be crippling, even fatal

17
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,555
Thoroughly cowed, the raven retreats.

18
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,550
The colony is saved, thanks to its members'
highly effective system of communication,

19
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,194
between themselves and with their enemy.

20
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,273
The messages proclaimed
by those Scandinavian fieldfares

21
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,916
could scarcely be misunderstood, even by us.

22
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,793
The first were calls to arms,

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,915
the second were battle cries
designed to intimidate the enemy.

24
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,035
But alarm calls aren't always
so easily recognised by outsiders.

25
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,030
Sometimes it's better to sound the alarm
more surreptitiously.

26
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,355
And that is something that birds
in an English wood do very well.

27
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,236
(BIRDS CHIRP)

28
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,709
That sound, for example, is a general alarm call.
It's short, very high-pitched,

29
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,198
and that makes it very difficult
to locate the bird that makes it.

30
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,597
It's a great tit.

31
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,954
Half hidden among the leaves, he continues
sending furtive signals to his family,

32
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,755
but all the birds around get the message.

33
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,869
An enemy would find it very hard to detect
where that sound is coming from.

34
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,477
Another warning.

35
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,636
This time it's from a robin.

36
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,877
He's telling his mate to stay still
until the danger has passed.

37
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,158
And that's the blackbird's version.

38
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,711
The begging cries of nestlings
could put them in danger.

39
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,438
A male chaffinch tells them to keep quiet.

40
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,236
And they do as they're told.

41
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,998
This surreptitious call is like an international
distress signal understood by everyone.

42
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,156
(BIRDCALL)

43
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,237
But that's a different kind of message.
That's not one that's sent surreptitiously to others.

44
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:46,879
It's aimed directly at me. It's a warning
to tell me that I've been spotted.

45
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,714
I'm too near this blackbird's mate
who's sitting on her nest.

46
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,199
His calls are almost continuous and much lower
pitched, because he wants to be located,

47
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,474
so that he can distract me away from her,
and even unsettle me.

48
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,029
Sound is not the only way to spread the alarm
or intimidate an intruder.

49
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,038
Some birds do the same thing visually.

50
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,188
Most of the time, this sunbittern is
well-camouflaged and unobtrusive.

51
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,756
Even less conspicuous than
the jacanas and the cayman

52
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,919
that also haunt the river's edge
here in Venezuela.

53
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,319
The river is continually bringing edible
bits and pieces within range,

54
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,308
and the sunbittern lives on them.
But he has competitors.

55
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,036
A hawk in the branches above
has spotted something.

56
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,630
So has the sunbittern.

57
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,272
But the hawk gets there first...

58
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,316
..and collects it.

59
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,914
A second hawk arrives.

60
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,511
If the sunbittern is to get anything at all,
it will have to frighten the others off.

61
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,830
So it transforms itself.

62
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,958
A ferocious, hissing, two-eyed monster
that doesn't exist is saving the day.

63
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,628
The hawk tries again.

64
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,999
But this startling display has convinced the hawks

65
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,034
that the bird down there is dangerous,
and they give up.

66
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,398
There is, of course, an alternative signal

67
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,798
Instead of saying
''I am here and extremely formidable'',

68
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,950
you could say ''I'm not here at all''.
That, of course, is a straightforward lie,

69
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:31,110
but there's a bird in these Brazilian forests
that tells the most convincing of lies.

70
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:38,110
Finding it is not easy. Indeed, I'm quite sure I've
walked past one many times without knowing it.

71
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,276
But this time, we're lucky.

72
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,716
It's sitting on the tree trunk.

73
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,151
It's a potoo, a kind of nightjar.

74
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,753
It hunts for insects at night, so, like any other
nightworker, it needs to rest during the day,

75
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,910
and it relies on the visual match between
its feathers and the tree trunk to protect it.

76
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,950
The only thing that could give it away
are its beak and its eyes.

77
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,833
Now I am getting quite close, so it decides
to improve its disguise even further.

78
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,398
And it does that by changing its posture
and closing those give-away eyes.

79
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,195
Now it's no more than the stump
of a broken branch.

80
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,148
You might think it would be dangerous to shut
your eyes just when danger approaches.

81
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,512
But, in fact, although its eyes are shut,
it can still see me.

82
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,029
There are two little hitches in its upper eyelid,

83
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,791
and its night-vision eyes are so sensitive
that it can still see what's going on.

84
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,718
As it watches me going away,
it relaxes and returns to its doze.

85
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,751
Most birds, of course, rely on their ability to fly
to keep them out of trouble,

86
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,398
and so, as you walk through an English wood,
they too vanish.

87
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,390
But establish their confidence
and they will soon come back.

88
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,596
And then you can see that they use their
plumage to send very different messages.

89
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,197
0ne finch meeting another needs to know
whether or not it's the same species.

90
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:42,350
If it is, it could be a rival, either for a mate or
for territory. If not, it can be largely ignored.

91
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:51,230
So finches with such similar body shapes
wear uniforms that make plain who they are.

92
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:58,709
And what works for other birds will also work
with us, provided we know the code.

93
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,716
Most bird-watchers do.

94
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,999
A grey-blue cap and reddish cheeks
identify a chaffinch.

95
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,718
A brown head and grey colour, a hawfinch.

96
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,318
A completely green head, a greenfinch.

97
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,198
A black cap and red cheeks, a buLLFinch.

98
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,798
And a red face and forehead, a goldfinch.

99
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,790
So every finch knows whether another is a rival
or not, and there are no pointless quarrels.

100
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,116
In the forests of Indonesia,
hornbills also use colour codes.

101
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,440
Several species there have predominantly
black and white plumage.

102
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,232
This one, however, the pied hornbill, has
yellowish areas on its white wing patches.

103
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,595
These are not accidental smudges.
This bird uses make-up.

104
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,038
With its beak, it squeezes a yellow oil
from a giant preen gland on its rump.

105
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,675
And it uses that oil to paint on
those yellow blotches.

106
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,756
And it's not just on its wings.

107
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,034
It adds yellow patches to its neck as well,
though they are more difficult to put on.

108
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,275
Even its huge bill
owes its yellow colour to the preen oil

109
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,998
Different kinds of hornbills
paint themselves different colours.

110
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,158
Whether these cosmetics are used
just for appearance's sake,

111
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,114
or whether they have
an additional purpose, we don't know.

112
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,550
But one thing is quite certain -
birds take a lot of care over their appearance.

113
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,395
All birds have good eyesight, a necessity
if they are to navigate at speed through the air.

114
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,512
In particular, they have excellent colour vision,

115
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,032
and that enables some species to have
the most gorgeous uniforms.

116
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,792
I can attract some of the most spectacular
using this bottle of artificial nectar.

117
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,038
The particular glory of hummingbirds
are their bibs and breast-shields.

118
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,150
Their colour is not pigment
but an optical effect created by refraction,

119
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,318
like the colours on a film of oil on water.

120
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,794
They are particularly attracted by red,

121
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,993
which is why I have got
red artificial flowers on this bottle.

122
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,355
They can also see in ultraviolet, a colour
that lies beyond the range of the human eye.

123
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,156
It's recently been discovered that many
of their feathers reflect ultraviolet,

124
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:44,037
so the likelihood is that these brilliant costumes
are even more vivid in their eyes

125
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,913
than they are in ours.

126
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,671
Many birds that we might think are plain
are almost gaudy in ultraviolet light.

127
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,077
If we look closely at starlings,
we can se a sheen to their plumage,

128
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:02,718
but that has an ultraviolet component that makes
them appear much more vivid to one another.

129
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,509
Blue tits, in our eyes, are one of the more
colourful of our garden birds.

130
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,509
But in ultraviolet they are much brighter still.

131
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,271
Their crests are particularly vivid
and much brighter in males than females.

132
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,759
So to them, the sexes look very different,
whereas to us blue tits all look the same.

133
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,995
We would all, I imagine, think that budgerigars
are unusually colourful birds.

134
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,796
But ultraviolet radically changes
the character of their costume.

135
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,396
Their feet glow.

136
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,078
And the spots on their cheeks, which are not
very prominent to our eyes, positively blaze.

137
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,918
Indeed, a budgerigar's full-dress uniform
is dramatic in the extreme.

138
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,319
Uniforms not only indicate an individual's
regiment, but his rank within that regiment.

139
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,908
Male sparrows have black bibs, but the size varies.

140
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,238
The more vigorous birds have bigger bibs
and therefore higher ranks.

141
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,873
Sparrows forage in flocks, and when there's
lots of food in a small area,

142
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,710
you might expect lots of quarrels,
but there aren't.

143
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,879
This is a private, with no badges.

144
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,789
This one is somewhat senior,
a sergeant, perhaps.

145
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,796
A captain.

146
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,596
And the colonel

147
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,272
There could be disputes not only over food
but over amenities like dust baths.

148
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,833
The privates are squabbling among themselves.

149
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,995
But watch what happens when a corporal steps in.

150
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,309
Junior ranks retreat.

151
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,319
0r when a corporal gets too close to a sergeant.

152
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,597
A sergeant, however, will give way to a captain.

153
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,670
And no one should think of parting
a colonel from his lunch.

154
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,394
A quick flourish of his insignia is quite enough.

155
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,396
Among birds that don't live in flocks

156
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,752
there's no need for the ranking system
to be so multi-layered.

157
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,874
Moorhens may mingle,
but each pair has its own territory.

158
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,235
Their badges are the red beak and head shield
and the white patches on either side of the tail

159
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,917
Rivals assess one another's strength
by the size and brilliance of those head shields.

160
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,275
If they feel their ranks are equal, then they may
not want to contest the position of the boundary,

161
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,429
and they display the white tail patches to indicate
that the confrontation is being broken off.

162
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,708
But here, the male on the right
is standing boldly upright.

163
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:50,870
He reckons he is the senior,
and he wants to enlarge his territory.

164
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,154
The time for sending messages is over. This
quarrel can only be settled by physical violence.

165
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,714
Birds can get badly injured in these battles,

166
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,357
but they have to be fought if a senior bird
is to establish and retain his rank.

167
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,116
Eventually the junior bird surrenders.
A new line has been drawn.

168
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,279
They won't need to fight again
as long as it's not over-stepped.

169
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,711
Communication by visual signals,
however, has one major limitation.

170
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,038
Except in completely open country,
they only work at close range.

171
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,869
In forests, sound signals will travel much further.

172
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,358
So if a bird, in order to get enough food,
needs a very large territory,

173
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,870
it is likely to declare its territorial claims
with sound.

174
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,108
There are, of course,
many different ways of making a noise,

175
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,835
and knocking on a resonant tree trunk
is one of them.

176
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,716
In this part of the world, in Patagonia
on the southernmost tip of South America,

177
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,755
two knocks on a tree trunk has a very
particular meaning, at least among birds.

178
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,918
If I do it, I might even get an answer.

179
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,751
(w00DPECKER KN0CKS 0N TREE)

(w00DPECKER KN0CKS 0N TREE)

182
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,830
It's a Magellanic woodpecker,

183
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,033
one of the largest of all woodpeckers,
and he thinks he has heard a rival

184
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,155
He comes in for a closer look.

185
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,234
(w00DPECKERS KN0CKING)

186
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,714
And here's his mate, coming to support him.

187
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,351
Now she joins in the dispute.

188
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,679
He is now on my tree,
and his mate is even closer.

189
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,234
I have stopped knocking, so it seems
to them that their rival has disappeared.

190
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,000
So all is well.

191
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,592
There's another drummer in the bird world,
Australia's palm cockatoo.

192
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,237
His beak is no good as a drum stick,
so he uses a wooden one.

193
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,120
(vIBRATING BIRDCALL)

194
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,198
And that noise too is made mechanically,
by an African broadbill.

195
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,513
It makes its call in the same way as children do
when they blow across a blade of grass.

196
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,669
But instead of grass, the broadbill has specially
strengthened and shaped wing feathers.

197
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,277
But, of course, most of the sounds
made by birds come from their throats.

198
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,790
The calls and songs that you hear
in a tropical rainforest, however,

199
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,278
are very different from those you might hear
in a European or North American woodland,

200
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,436
and there's a reason for that.

201
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:27,552
The leaves in a tropical rainforest have
smooth and shiny surfaces that reflect sound.

202
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,153
So a complex call up here
would have its notes slurred and confused.

203
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,353
As a result, birds that live up here
tend to have calls

204
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,997
that are simple, short, and often very, very loud.

205
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,196
(SHRILL BIRDCALL)

206
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,151
That's the loudest of all...

207
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,113
..from a bare-throated bell bird.

208
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,678
And this is a close rival, a screaming piha.

209
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,668
Toucans must also be close to the top ten.

210
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,792
All these birds call from high up in the canopy.

211
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,278
Lower down, where the foliage is less dense,
the calls can be different.

212
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,755
For one thing, they can be longer.

213

(L0NG DRAWN-0UT CALL)

214
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,199
That's a currasow.

215
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,638
And this...a wattled guan.

216
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,233
A longer call, of course, can contain more notes.

217
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,236
A kagu in New Caledonia. This is a female.

218
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,838
Her mate, some distance away, is listening.

219
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,032
The family wandered apart as they foraged,
and now they want to get together again.

220
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,353
Her son has also heard the message.

221
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,560
So the adult pair are reunited,

222
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,719
and they greet one another as usual
with a visual display.

223
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,036
But their son is still out there, somewhere.

224
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,354
And once again, the family group is complete.

225
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,790
The calls of the kagu
can be heard half a mile away.

226
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,470
But some birds need to communicate
over even greater distances,

227
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,037
and the best way to do that is
with very low-pitched notes.

228
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,596
An American bittern.

229
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,956
An air sac in his chest acts as a resonator,

230
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,914
so he starts by gulping in air and pumping it up.

231
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:09,958
This call carries for over two miles,
even through the thickets of reeds.

232
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,830
And when the performance is over,
the air sac slowly deflates.

233
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,751
If you can get out of the reeds,
then your calls are less impeded.

234
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:55,798
The Australian musk duck does just that
in order to broadcast his messages.

235
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,235
And the smooth surface of the water also helps
to reflect the sound far across the lake.

236
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:23,152
The flap on his chin is a visual signal for
any birds that come over for a closer look.

237
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,636
However, if calls are directed
to neighbours nearby,

238
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,798
then they can become very elaborate.

239
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,516
This red bishop makes an almost constant
stream of high-pitched notes

240
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,678
as he hops around his territory.

241
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,915
And you can't get much more elaborate than this.

242
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,749
The extraordinary display of the 0ropendula
includes one of the strangest songs of all.

243
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,916
So how do birds do it?

244
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:19,515
How, for example, can canaries sing
continuously for minutes on end?

245
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,194
Slowing the singer down,
which also lowers the pitch of the notes,

246
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,516
allows us to understand what's happening.

247
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,919
Between the notes it takes mini-breaths
to replenish its air supply,

248
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,557
and in full song it may do so 30 times a second.

249
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,759
A bird's voice box can also produce
two different notes simultaneously.

250
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,397
It's not high in the throat like ours,
but deep in its chest.

251
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,869
Low notes come from one side.
High from the other.

252
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,758
By alternating between high and low notes,

253
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,589
even short songs can carry
very complex messages.

254
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,310
And this is the champion.

255
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,669
The cowbird uses over 40 different notes
in his songs.

256
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,635
Some of them are so high that they are
beyond the hearing of many of us.

257
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,237
0ne again, if we slow the action down,
we can hear what's going on.

258
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,469
The left side is producing the low notes.

259
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,675
And the right, the high.

260
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,439
0thers are made by combining
the sounds higher up in the throat.

261
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,079
It may take a cowbird two years
to learn his song properly.

262
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,238
And it's important that birds should
get their calls exactly right,

263
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:32,276
for they can be just as significant
in proclaiming identity as their uniforms.

264
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,470
Indeed, if a bird has a shy and retiring disposition,

265
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,150
and lives in a secluded place
like this English woodland,

266
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,593
then its voice may be the only way
that it can be recognised by another bird,

267
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,758
or indeed by a bird-watcher.

268
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,635
There are two kinds of warblers here.

269
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,277
This is a chiff-chaff, fuelling up
after its long flight from Africa.

270
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,431
And this is a willow-warbler.
To me it looks virtually identical

271
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,556
But wait until they sing.

272
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,836
This is a chiff-chaff.

273
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,993
And this, a willow-warbler.

274
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,271
There's no mistaking who's who,
as long as you can hear their calls.

275
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:02,676
But a bird's call can tell another bird more
than just what kind of bird it is that's singing.

276
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:10,079
This patch of bush on a small New Zealand
island belongs to a male saddleback.

277
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,430
He has held it throughout the year,

278
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,316
and he knows who his neighbours are
because their calls vary slightly.

279
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,311
And he can recognise each one individually.
And there he is.

280
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,479
Throughout the day he keeps in regular
contact with his neighbours.

281
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,199
They each answer his call,
and he can distinguish between them

282
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,110
in the same way that we can distinguish
between regional dialects.

283
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,874
A northerner.

284
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,074
A southerner.

285
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,116
And someone from the east coast.

286
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,631
If the right call comes from the right place,
then he knows that his territory is safe,

287
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,798
and he can happily go back to feeding.

288
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,549
But if the call is from a saddleback,
one that he doesn't recognise,

289
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,514
and if, as well as that, it comes
from a completely new place,

290
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,632
then he will react in a very different way.

291
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:32,914
And, of course, it's quite easy for me
to make that happen.

292
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,995
I'm going to play him a recording of
a saddleback from a different island.

293
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,996
His response is swift and very aggressive.

294
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,874
He comes down for a closer look.

295
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,596
He gives another warning.

296
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,958
This is a serious challenge to his territory.
It can't be tolerated.

297
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,637
Now, since his rival seems to be close by,

298
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,515
he's making a visual threat,
displaying the brown patch on his back.

299
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,475
He is ready to fight, if only he could find
who it is who needs fighting.

300
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,234
Well, I guess that's enough of that.
We'll leave him in peace.

301
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,236
To may of us, however,
this is the most delectable of natural sounds.

302
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:13,149
It's an hour before dawn, it's spring,
this is an English woodland.

303
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,238
All around, the dawn chorus.

304
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,637
It's so familiar
that perhaps we take it for granted.

305
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,116
But there's a lot we don't know about it still.

306
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:40,230
As first light brightens, different kinds
of birds, one by one, join the choir.

307
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,628
(INCREASING DAWN CH0RUS)

308
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,512
(M0RE AND M0RE BIRDS J0IN IN)

309
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,115
Why should they all sing together at this time?

310
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,871
Wouldn't it be better for some to sing later,
by themselves?

311
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,230
And that's not the only puzzle.

312
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,996
Why should it happen at this time of day?
Well, at dawn it's still quite cold.

313
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:29,230
Insects are not yet up and about,  so for
many of the birds there's nothing to eat.

314
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,273
So they might as well sing.

315
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,831
There's another possible reason.
It's usually quite calm at dawn,

316
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,989
and with no wind these messages will travel
far and still be recognisable.

317
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,318
The chorus is the equivalent
of our early morning news,

318
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,115
except that it is broadcast
in fifty languages.

319
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,396
By listening to it, this wren knows
which of its neighbours is still alive.

320
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,076
He knows where they are.

321
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,278
And if there are any new males
on the scene.

322
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:05,790
Each kind of bird listens to its own particular
section of the sound spectrum.

323
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,435
The song thrush broadcasts in the mid-range.

324
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,193
The wood pigeon's calls are somewhat lower.

325
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:40,312
Smaller birds, like the firecrest,
use the higher frequencies.

326
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,749
These spring-time messages from male birds
not only say ''This is my patch'',

327
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,715
they also say to passing females
''Why don't you come and join me?''

328
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,235
Robins have now extended their usual
songs to carry this additional message.

329
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,154
The male chaffinch has done the same.

330
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,397
He may sing his song
over 500,000 times in a season.

331
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,358
By late spring, migrants have arrived
from southern Europe and Africa,

332
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,711
and are adding their voices to the chorus.

333
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,114
A wood warbler.

334
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,591
A pied flycatcher.

335
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,874
And a redstart.

336
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:30,314
His mate, like many, will be impressed by
the originality and complexity of his song.

337
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:39,752
The male sedge warbler can produce fifty different
notes and never sings the same song twice.

338
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,876
He's like a jazz singer, continually improvising,

339
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,868
and different males
develop different singing styles.

340
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,477
And this is perhaps the most lyrical
of all European songsters.

341
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,158
A nightingale.

342
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,839
He may have three hundred
different love songs in his repertoire.

343
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,599
And he will sing for a mate
all through the night.

344
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,913
What bird has the most elaborate,

345
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,396
the most complex,
the most beautiful song in the world?

346
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:24,991
I guess there are lots of contenders,
but this bird must be one of them,

347
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,954
the superb lyrebird of southern Australia.

348
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,598
He clears a space in the forest
to serve as his concert platform.

349
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,676
To persuade females to come close
and admire his plumes,

350
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,394
he sings the most complex song he can.

351
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:10,469
And he does that by copying the songs
of all the other birds he hears around him,

352
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,636
such as the kookaburra.

353
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,993
It's a very convincing impersonation.

354
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,356
Even the original is fooled.

355
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,750
He can imitate the calls of at least
twenty different species.

356
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:51,199
He also, in his attempt to out-sing his rivals,
incorporates others sounds in the forest.

357
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,552
That was a camera shutter.

358
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,434
And again.

359
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,754
And now a camera with a motor drive.

360
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,192
And that's a car alarm.

361
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:31,228
And now the sounds of foresters
and their chain-saws working nearby.

362
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,592
That wonderful performance is
only one example of the extent

363
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,190
to which male birds will go
in order to attract a female.

364
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:06,519
The range and sheer extravagance of their
courtship displays can be quite astonishing.

365
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,594
The range of relationships between male
and female that these displays lead to

366
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,715
is also much more varied
than you might suppose.

367
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,789
And it's that, the most crucial stage
in the life of any bird,

368
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,390
that we'll be looking at
in the next programme.
