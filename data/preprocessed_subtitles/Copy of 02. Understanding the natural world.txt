25
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,280
called king solomon ring

live television

28
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,120
started saying professor lorenz understand

29
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,480
speak greylag goose language

30
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,520
actually greylag goose

34
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,640
lorenz said dear dear trousers

35
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,280
embarrassed took handkerchief

36
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,160

43
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,640
today film makers use imprinting

44
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,200
technique purposes

45
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,880
