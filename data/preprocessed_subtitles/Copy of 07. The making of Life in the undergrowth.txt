know got lot choose

12
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:59,167
oddly mean largely ignored filmmakers

13
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:04,958
wildlife filmmakers partly difficulty filming

14
00:01:05,047 --> 00:01:09,006
know filming small creatures

15
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:13,717
recently advances lenses

16
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,765

38
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:05,678
hopefully people nice insight know world

39
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:09,760
know certain extent ignore

40
00:03:09,847 --> 00:03:13,078
tread undergrowth time

41
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:14,725
know

42
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:19,642
notice obvious ones beautiful things like butterflies

43
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:23,436
ones buzz annoy sting

44
00:03:23,527 --> 00:03:25,757
lot choose

45
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:32,403
insects invertebrates important humans

46
00:03:32,487 --> 00:03:37,925
know david attenborough statement makes point

47
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:43,081
vertebrate animals know

48
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:47,285
mammals birds disappeared

49
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:50,120
difference world

50
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:53,404
fact probably world darn sight better

51
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:58,001
insects disappeared

52
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:04,283
instance knee high dung

53
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:07,803
imagine beetles

54
00:04:07,887 --> 00:04:11,402
obvious dung beetles plains africa

ones chew leaf litter

60
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:37,157
turn nice growing medium plants

61
00:04:38,087 --> 00:04:44,162
know obvious important role insects play

62
00:04:44,247 --> 00:04:45,839
pollination

63
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:50,763
know evolved flowering plants

64
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:56,843
lot particularly bees wasps flying insects

65
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:05,205
enormous role play pollinating know flowers

66

crops

67
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:12,685
ways prominent important

68
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:19,443
prime aim series right

69
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:24,960
level ants tiny tiny creatures

70
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:28,437
cameras right

71
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:33,402
means actually getting lenses know level

72
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:39,246
think lenses great advance recently

73
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:44,845
got sort better depth focus

74
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:50,604
know tiny insect millimetres long thing

75
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:55,522
background helps place environment

76
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:59,486
create sort miniature world trying

77
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,127
trying scale

78
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:08,077

believe absolutely petrified

182
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,844
particularly redback spiders

183
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:15,365
know lot australian spiders pretty venomous need avoid

184
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,402
redback spiders ones come people homes

185
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:23,799
like sort hard surfaces like toilets things like

186
00:14:24,287 --> 00:14:28,565
child awful experiences things

187
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:33,004
think bitten nearly died 'cause kill child

188
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:36,643
decided wanted learn

189
00:14:36,727 --> 00:14:40,083
world expert things

series lines stumbles

197
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:11,559
like ant

198
00:15:11,647 --> 00:15:15,117

201
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:28,443
goes ping"and shoots spider waiting grab

202
00:15:28,807 --> 00:15:34,404
know great thing behold

203
00:15:34,487 --> 00:15:40,483
arachnophobe guy worked helped film

204
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:43,284
new behaviour

205
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:47,280
think thing

206
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:51,918
real eye opener team working series

207
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:58,719
creatures hope look

208
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:04,723
think invertebrates studied

209
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:06,160

210
00:16:06,247 --> 00:16:10,957
mean new species found new behaviours time

211
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:12,560
erm

212
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:18,999
found know

213
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:25,037
biologists work finding things time

214
00:16:25,127 --> 00:16:29,120
keen know tell stories

215
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:33,883
involved filming stuff

216
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:38,598
