crucially ice blocks dam river running free

665
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,151
date breakup

666
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,231
red got right

667
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:11,873
use gauges mechanical assistance

668
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:17,160
river walk

669
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:21,632
walk forth day river

670

happening

671
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:27,234
gauge going hit

672
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:30,711
situation going like

673
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,393
know went morning

674
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,120
said students guess date

675
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,111
red told

676
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,669
know surprised couple times

677
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,875
happened

678
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,429
days weeks looks goes

679
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,239
like know

attenborough ice scientists improving

683
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,714
accuracy predictions time

684
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,835
meantime

685
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,197
people hay river remarkable guardian

686
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,270
linfield red completely right year

687
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,078
right year

688
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,436
miss laughs

689
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,511
