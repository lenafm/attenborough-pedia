# attenborough-pedia

**Describe briefly your idea**

We have the subtitles and videos from all Attenborough (200+ episodes) documentaries and we want to have fun with this data and learn from each other + maybe answer some fun questions on the way. Learn about NLP, topic modelling, network analysis, data visualisation.

**Do you have a research question? (It's ok if the answer is "not yet")**

Investigate Attenborough's use of language.
Look at this over time: how has his use of language/topics changed?
Are there commonly used adjectives for certain species?

**What is everyone's role in the group?**

Violeta: the boss <br/>
Lena: the secretary <br/>
Ben: the code monkey <br/>
Thibault: the language expert <br/>
Sophia: the learning puppy <br/>
Darcy: the learning bird <br/>

**What do you expect to achieve by the end of summer school?**

Process data <br/>
Some visualisations <br/>
Initial analysis (for example, network of animals linked by common adjectives) <br/>
Surprise! <br/>
